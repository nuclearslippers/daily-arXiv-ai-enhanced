### [1] [Social Bias in Multilingual Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20201)
*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对多语言预训练模型中的社会偏见研究进行了系统综述，分析了偏见评估和缓解方法在多语言和非英语环境中的应用现状、挑战及未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练多语言模型存在与英语模型类似的社会偏见问题，需要系统研究如何将这些偏见的评估和缓解方法扩展到多语言和非英语语境中。

Method: 通过系统文献综述方法，分析现有研究在语言多样性、文化意识、评估指标和缓解技术选择等方面的表现。

Result: 发现该领域存在方法论设计选择上的差距（如偏好某些语言、多语言缓解实验稀缺），同时整理了跨语言和文化适应偏见基准时的常见问题和解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以增强多语言偏见研究的包容性、跨文化适当性以及与最先进NLP进展的一致性。

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

### [2] [Prompting Strategies for Language Model-Based Item Generation in K-12 Education: Bridging the Gap Between Small and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20217)
*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用语言模型自动生成形态评估的多项选择题，通过结构化提示策略和高效微调提升中等规模模型性能，为K-12语言评估提供实用可扩展的工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在降低人工测试开发成本和不一致性，探索在有限数据条件下使用语言模型自动生成高质量评估项目的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：比较微调的中等模型(Gemma, 2B)与未调优的大模型(GPT-3.5)；评估七种结构化提示策略，包括零样本、少样本、思维链、基于角色、顺序等组合方法。使用自动化指标和专家评分进行评估，并利用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人工评分。

Result: 结构化提示策略（特别是思维链与顺序设计组合）显著提升Gemma输出质量。Gemma生成的项目比GPT-3.5的零样本响应更符合构念和教学适宜性，提示设计对中等规模模型性能起关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效微调可在有限数据条件下增强中等规模模型的自动生成能力。结合自动化指标、专家判断和大模型模拟能确保与评估目标的一致性，为K-12语言评估项目开发提供实用可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

### [3] [Integrating SystemC TLM into FMI 3.0 Co-Simulations with an Open-Source Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20223)
*Andrei Mihai Albu,Giovanni Pollo,Alessio Burrello,Daniele Jahier Pagliari,Cristian Tesconi,Alessandra Neri,Dario Soldi,Fabio Autieri,Sara Vinco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将SystemC TLM模型集成到FMI协同仿真工作流的开源方法，通过将SystemC组件封装为FMI 3.0 FMU实现跨域集成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息物理系统复杂度的增加，特别是汽车应用中，需要高效的建模和跨域协同仿真技术。SystemC TLM在硬件/软件协同设计方面有效，但与其他工程领域模型的互操作性有限

Method: 开发了完全开源的方法论，将SystemC TLM组件封装为FMI 3.0协同仿真功能模型单元(FMU)，提供轻量级开源工具链，解决时间同步和数据交换等关键技术挑战

Result: 通过代表性案例研究证明了集成的可行性和有效性，实现了异构仿真环境间的无缝标准化集成

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了SystemC TLM与其他工程领域模型的集成挑战，为跨域协同仿真提供了有效的开源解决方案

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [4] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DGPO方法，通过教师演示的冷启动初始化和持续教师指导，解决小语言模型在强化学习训练中的稀疏奖励和训练不稳定问题，使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）由于推理能力差，在强化学习训练中面临稀疏奖励和训练不稳定的问题，需要一种方法来克服这些困难。

Method: Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO)，包括从教师演示进行冷启动初始化，以及在策略优化过程中提供持续的教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超越了更大的教师模型，使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现代理RAG成为可能。

Conclusion: DGPO方法有效解决了小模型在强化学习训练中的挑战，通过教师指导使紧凑模型能够胜任复杂的代理搜索任务，为资源受限环境提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [5] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一种将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作测试问题的方法，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM合规性，并引入越狱诊断来识别潜在安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害内容引发了社会担忧。政府发布的伦理指南缺乏具体测试方法，需要将高层要求转化为可操作的测试问题。

Method: GUARD方法通过自动生成违反政府指南的问题来测试LLM响应合规性。对于不直接违反指南的响应，引入GUARD-JD进行越狱诊断，创建可能绕过安全机制的场景来激发不道德响应。

Result: 在7个LLM（包括Vicuna、Llama系列、GPT系列和Claude）上实证验证了有效性，测试了三个政府指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断。GUARD-JD还可迁移到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种系统化的方法来验证LLM对政府伦理指南的遵守情况，能够识别直接违规和潜在安全漏洞，有助于促进可靠的LLM应用开发。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [6] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个通过图推理增强大语言模型长文本理解能力的新框架，包含摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个核心组件，在多个评估指标上优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理长上下文时面临的内存限制、复杂任务处理困难、缺乏透明度和容易产生幻觉等问题。

Method: 采用三步框架：1）策略性文本分块提取摘要；2）构建有向无环图消除冗余；3）结合蒙特卡洛树搜索进行复杂推理路径导航。

Result: 在ROUGE和F1指标上持续优于所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR框架为大语言模型处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了可靠且透明的解决方案，显著提升了模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

### [7] [Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373)
*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用NP难图问题作为合成训练语料来增强大语言模型的长链推理能力，通过两阶段后训练框架（监督微调+强化学习）显著提升了模型在数学、编程等复杂推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长链推理能力的开发主要依赖昂贵的人工标注数据集，缺乏可扩展的替代方案。NP难图问题天然具备深度推理、广泛探索和反思策略等长链推理核心特征，可作为有效的合成训练资源。

Method: 两阶段后训练框架：1）在拒绝采样的NP难图问题上进行长链推理监督微调，增强推理深度；2）通过细粒度奖励设计的强化学习，提高推理效率。

Result: 旗舰模型Graph-R1-7B在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑推理任务上表现出强泛化能力，在NP难图问题上超越QwQ-32B模型，在准确性和推理效率方面均有优势。

Conclusion: NP难图问题为LLM的长链推理后训练提供了有效且可扩展的新资源，开辟了LLM后训练的新前沿。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [8] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知的人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估LLM的行为特质，发现上下文增强一致性但会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文依赖程度不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试采用无上下文方法评估LLM，忽略了真实对话中历史对话对响应的影响，需要开发更贴近实际应用的评估框架

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入对话历史上下文，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性但引起人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，Gemini和Llama敏感；GPT响应源于内在人格和先前交互，而Gemini和Llama严重依赖先前交互；在角色扮演代理中上下文依赖的人格偏移改善一致性并更符合人类判断

Conclusion: 上下文感知评估揭示了LLM行为特质的复杂性，为更准确评估LLM人格提供了新框架，有助于理解LLM在真实对话场景中的表现

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [9] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式，研究发现熵值递减与正确答案强相关，而熵值平坦或递增通常导致错误答案，为设计高效推理管道提供理论基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型依赖中间推理步骤提升准确性，但缺乏对推理步骤效用的系统性研究。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多内容并不能保证答案置信度提升，需要预测推理步骤的有效性以实现早期停止或修剪无效步骤

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）测量模型在每一步推理步骤中对答案跨度Y的不确定性

Result: 发现明显模式：条件熵随步骤递减与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵通常导致错误答案。错误推理路径往往比正确路径更长，表明更长的推理不一定产生更好结果

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理管道奠定了基础，能够早期检测和避免无效推理，提高大语言模型的推理效率和准确性

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

Motivation: 当前缺乏公开基准来严格验证AI文本转应用工具声称的高质量应用和网站生成能力，需要建立标准化的评估体系。

Method: 使用专家两两比较方法，涵盖10个工具、30个提示词、300个生成网站和4000+专家判断，采用TrueSkill模型进行系统排名并计算校准置信区间。

Result: 建立了首个大规模AI文本转应用工具视觉质量基准测试，提供了完整的提示词集、开源评估框架和公开排行榜。

### [11] [DentalBench: Benchmarking and Advancing LLMs Capability for Bilingual Dentistry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20416)
*Hengchuan Zhu,Yihuan Xu,Yichen Li,Zijie Meng,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含问答数据集和大规模语料库，用于评估和提升LLM在牙科专业领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用医学基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专业医学领域能力尚未充分探索，缺乏针对性的评估资源。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准，包含DentalQA（36,597个中英文问答问题，涵盖4个任务和16个牙科子领域）和DentalCorpus（3.37亿token的大规模高质量语料库），支持监督微调和检索增强生成。评估了14个LLM模型，并进行领域适应实验。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距。领域适应实验（使用Qwen-2.5-3B）表明领域适应显著提升模型性能，特别是在知识密集和术语集中的任务上。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准测试对于开发可信赖且有效的医疗应用LLM至关重要，牙科领域需要专门的评估和适应方法来提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

### [12] [KG-CQR: Leveraging Structured Relation Representations in Knowledge Graphs for Contextual Query Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20417)
*Chi Minh Bui,Ngoc Mai Thieu,Van Vinh Nguyen,Json J. Jung,Khac-Hoai Nam Bui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个基于知识图谱的上下文查询检索框架，通过提取和补全相关KG子图来丰富查询表示，在RAG系统中显著提升了检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的语义丰富表示。知识图谱与LLMs的结合有潜力改善RAG系统的检索阶段

Method: 提出KG-CQR框架，包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成三个模块。通过语料中心知识图谱的结构化关系表示来丰富查询上下文，是一个模型无关的管道方法

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上表现优异，mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%。在多跳问答等挑战性任务中检索效果持续优于现有基线

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱增强查询表示，有效提升了RAG系统的检索性能，具有模型无关性和可扩展性优势

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Conclusion: 该研究填补了当前LLM评测在专业垂直领域的空白，为民航维修领域提供了一个标准化的评测工具。这个标准能够持续推动领域内智能解决方案的发展，并为领域特定的模型优化提供了基础。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决实践工作标题搜索问题，利用历史案例经验来提高搜索效率和准确性

Method: 使用案例推理(CBR)方法，结合TF-IDF进行文本向量化，采用余弦相似度计算标题相似性

Result: 在705个实践工作标题的测试中，系统在两个测试阶段都成功找到了相同数量的匹配标题，并获得了最高的平均匹配分数

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效搜索实践工作标题，无论是完整标题还是关键词形式，TF-IDF和余弦相似度的组合在案例检索中表现优异

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

TL;DR: MCP-Bench是一个基于Model Context Protocol的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在真实多步骤任务中的工具使用能力，包含28个MCP服务器和250个跨领域工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要依赖显式工具规范、浅层工作流和孤立领域操作，无法充分评估LLM在模糊指令下检索工具、多跳执行规划、跨域工作流协调等关键能力。

Method: 基于MCP协议构建基准，连接28个代表性实时MCP服务器，涵盖金融、旅行、科学计算、学术搜索等领域，设计真实多步骤任务测试模型能力。

Result: 在20个先进LLM上的实验揭示了MCP-Bench中的持续挑战，表明现有模型在多步骤工具使用和跨域协调方面仍存在显著困难。

Conclusion: MCP-Bench提供了一个更真实、全面的评估框架，揭示了LLM在复杂工具使用任务中的局限性，为未来模型开发提供了重要基准。

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

*Yucheng Ruan,Xiang Lan,Daniel J. Tan,Hairil Rizal Abdullah,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于深度学习和自然语言处理的多模态电子健康记录分析框架，用于预测ICU患者的死亡率和资源利用情况，在多个临床任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICU预测方法主要关注结构化电子健康记录，忽略了自由文本临床笔记中的宝贵信息，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。

Method: 使用两个真实世界EHR数据集，开发了包含医学提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器的深度学习框架，并通过消融实验验证各组件的重要性，同时测试模型对结构化数据损坏的鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个临床任务上，模型性能显著提升：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提高1.6%/0.8%，住院时长预测RMSE/MAE改善0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%，且在不同数据损坏率下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，证明了使用提示学习和Transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的成功，并展现出对结构化数据损坏的强大抗干扰能力。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ConspirED数据集，用于分析阴谋论内容的认知特征，开发了识别模型并评估了大语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成虚假信息的日益复杂化，理解阴谋论内容的修辞模式对于开发干预措施和评估AI脆弱性至关重要。

Method: 引入ConspirED数据集，基于CONSPIR认知框架对在线阴谋文章的多句摘录进行标注，开发计算模型识别阴谋特征，并评估大语言模型对阴谋论输入的响应。

Result: 发现大语言模型容易被阴谋论内容误导，产生反映输入推理模式的输出，即使能够成功处理类似的事实核查错误信息。

Conclusion: ConspirED是首个标注阴谋论认知特征的数据集，揭示了AI模型在应对阴谋论内容时的脆弱性，为开发针对性干预措施提供了基础。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+基准测试在200多种语言的机器翻译评估中存在质量问题，包括翻译质量低于声称标准、领域特异性强、文化偏见严重，以及命名实体复制可获高分等漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试的实际适用性，发现其在真正多语言评估方面存在严重缺陷，需要更准确的评估标准。

Method: 通过对四种语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的人工评估，分析翻译质量、领域相关性和文化偏见，并使用简单启发式方法测试评估协议的漏洞。

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于90%标准，源句子过于领域特定且具有英语世界文化偏见，简单命名实体复制就能获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现差但在相关领域数据集上表现好。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立使用领域通用和文化中立源文本、减少依赖命名实体的多语言MT基准测试，以更好地反映现实世界翻译挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Motivation: 现有主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越能力为解决这一问题提供了新的思路。

Method: 1) 构建文本编码器捕获科学文献内容；2) 设计空间优化模块，集成基于熵的采样和LLM指导的三元组任务；3) 基于LLM指导微调文本编码器，通过优化三元组对比损失使编码器更好区分不同主题的实例。

Conclusion: SciTopic通过利用大语言模型的强大理解能力，有效提升了科学文献主题发现的性能，为研究者提供了更好的科学信息检索和分析工具。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

Motivation: 现有联邦蓬泽方法主要关注标签异质性，而忽视了语言域的多样性，这在自然语言处理中很重要。需要一种能够处理多域非IID数据挑战的方案。

Method: 提出适配性联邦蓬泽（AdaFD）框架，设计了一套综合的多域非IID场景和基准测试框架，支持同构和异构设置。

Result: 实验结果显示，该模型能够抓住本地客户端的多样性，与现有方法相比获得更好的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦学习领域提供了一种有效的方案来处理多域非IID数据挑战，并建立了可用于真实环境评估的基准测试框架。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Motivation: 传统基于排序候选摘要片段的抽取式摘要模型存在两个关键局限：1）多阶段流水线导致累积信息损失和架构瓶颈；2）缺乏对用户查询和文档的充分语义理解，特别是在处理复杂搜索意图时表现不佳。

Method: 整合大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码技术，将轻量级模型（仅0.1B参数）转化为领域专业化的QDTS专家。

Result: 在多个行业相关指标上超越生产基线，达到新的最先进水平；部署效率优异，仅需334个NVIDIA L20 GPU即可处理约50,000 QPS，平均延迟55ms。

Conclusion: 生成式模型在工业网络搜索的实时查询驱动文本摘要任务中展现出显著优势，为大规模应用提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

Motivation: 多跳问答面临数据稀疏性挑战，导致语言模型容易学习虚假模式。现有方法主要关注简单问题生成，但忽略了文档中相关句子的知识整合。

Method: KCS将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测下一个最相关的知识片段，在推理时采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性。

Conclusion: KCS框架通过有效的知识组合采样策略，成功提升了多跳问答问题的生成多样性和准确性，为解决数据稀疏性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有的图语言模型评估基准主要基于节点分类数据集，这些基准无法真正评估图结构和语言的多模态整合能力，因为单模态信息就足以在这些基准上取得良好表现。

Method: 提出了CLEGR（组合式语言-图推理）基准，采用合成图生成流程配合需要结构和文本语义联合推理的问题。对代表性GLM架构进行了全面评估，并与软提示LLM基线进行比较。

Result: 研究发现软提示LLM基线与包含完整GNN骨干的GLM表现相当，质疑了在LLM中整合图结构的架构必要性。GLM在需要结构推理的任务中表现出显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前GLM在图推理能力方面存在局限，CLEGR基准为推进图结构与语言的多模态推理研究提供了基础，揭示了需要更有效的架构设计来真正实现图语言整合。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的实体编辑方法，解决了现有方法在词形差异较大时的限制，并将开源相关数据集。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Result: RoBERTa-HArch在英语中表现最佳，XLM-RoBERTa-HArch在多语言设置中表现最佳；微调模型 consistently 优于GPT-4o和Llama-4-Maverick的少样本提示方法；在DiscoGeM 1.0语料上取得SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 层次化方法在隐式篇章关系识别中有效，任务特定的微调优于提示方法，模型在多语言和多标签设置下均表现优异。

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大语言模型中的标记化不一致性问题，提出了针对文本隐写术和水印技术的两种解决方案，并验证了这些方法在流畅性、隐藏性和突破性方面的改善效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型既提升了文本隐写术的质量，也强调了水印技术作为防范恶意使用的重要性。标记化不一致性会影响系统的突破性，需要解决这个问题。

Method: 识别出导致标记化不一致的问题标记具有频率低和临时性两大特征，并提出两种解决方案：针对隐写术的步进验证方法，以及针对水印技术的事后回滚方法。

Result: 实验结果显示：(1)在隐写术中，直接解决标记化不一致性比传统消除歧义方法在流畅性、隐藏性和反隐写分析能力方面更优；(2)在水印技术中，解决标记化不一致性提高了检测能力和对攻击的突破性。

Conclusion: 通过识别并针对性地解决标记化不一致性问题，可以有效提升文本隐写术和水印技术的性能，为大语言模型的安全应用提供更好的保障。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent是一个14B参数的数学推理模型，通过智能体强化学习训练，在有限GPU资源下实现了前沿性能，在AIME数学竞赛中超越了更大的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长链思维方法存在局限性，需要开发能够自主探索、验证和精炼中间步骤的智能推理模型，同时降低训练成本。

Method: 采用三阶段训练方法：非推理SFT预训练、多阶段RL训练，结合GRPO-RoC算法和高效的Python代码执行环境，通过重采样策略处理代码环境噪声。

Result: 在仅510个RL步骤和一周训练时间内，实现了AIME24 80.6%和AIME25 69.8%的pass@1分数，超越了DeepSeek-R1(671B)模型，且响应更短。

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了小模型通过智能体强化学习可以实现前沿性能，在数学推理、科学推理和工具使用任务上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下实现邻域感知的文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理，在较低ε值下实现隐私保护与文本连贯性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理方法在低ε值下效果不佳，需要高ε值才能获得合理结果，这限制了实际应用中的隐私保护效果。

Method: 提出DP-ST方法，基于语义三元组进行分治处理，结合LLM后处理生成连贯文本，将隐私保护限制在特定的邻域范围内。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯文本，有效平衡了隐私保护与文本实用性，相比现有方法在低隐私预算下表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过限制隐私保护邻域范围并结合LLM处理，可以在合理ε水平下实现隐私保护与文本连贯性的良好平衡，分治策略是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

TL;DR: 通过细调基于大语言模型的通用嵌入模型，在隐式代码性令人厌恼语言检测中实现了独立的最新性能，特别是在跨数据集评估中显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式令人厌恼语言通过隐秘提示、讽刺或代码术语传递偏见和恨愁，因不包含明显谬辱性词汇而难以检测。传统方法需要外部知识或额外信息来补充，本文探索仅通过细调通用嵌入模型的简单方法。

Method: 仅通过细调最新的通用嵌入模型（基于大语言模型）如Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed和E5。方法简洁无需额外外部知识、上下文、情感或情感数据的支持。

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上进行实验，在内部数据集评估中获得了至1.10个百分点的F1-macro分数提升，在跨数据集评估中更是获得了至20.35个百分点的显著提升。

Conclusion: 细调通用嵌入模型是检测隐式令人厌恼语言的有效方法，不仅能达到最新的性能水平，而且在模型迁移和通用性方面表现特别优异，为处理这种复杂语言现象提供了简洁而高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出GUARD方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差的"Glocal"不确定性驱动框架，并加入基于token计数的惩罚机制来降低计算开销。

Result: 实验表明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证了其优异性能。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种有效且高效的自适应解码方案，为开放式文本生成提供了新的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过情感弧线分析比较了真实与LLM生成的认知行为疗法对话，发现合成对话在情感动态方面与真实会话存在显著差异，特别是情感变化性和真实性不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的合成治疗对话在心理健康NLP领域的应用增多，需要评估这些合成对话是否能够准确投射真实治疗中的细致情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析价值(valence)、舌动(arousal)和主导(dominance)维度的情感弧线，比较真实CBT会话(来自公开视频转写)和合成对话(来自CACTUS数据集)的情感特征。

Result: 合成对话虽然流畅且结构一致，但在情感特性上与真实对话存在显著差异：真实会话呈现更高的情感变化性、更多情感化语言以及更真实的反应和调节模式。情感弧线相似度低，尤其是客户端。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的治疗数据在情感保真度方面存在显著限制，心理健康应用中情感准确性至关重要。研究团队提供了RealCBT数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

TL;DR: ROSI是一种白盒方法，通过永久性地将模型激活导向拒绝中介子空间来增强LLM的安全对齐，无需微调即可提高安全拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制容易被绕过，需要一种简单有效的方法来增强LLM的安全对齐能力。

Method: 提出Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)方法，通过对所有残差流写入矩阵应用简单的秩一权重修改，将激活永久导向安全拒绝方向。

Result: ROSI能持续提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag和Arc等基准测试中保持模型效用，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型。

Conclusion: 定向、可解释的权重导向是改善LLM安全性的廉价而有效的机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕获全局特征，显著提升了少数关系类的性能并改善了整体学习能力

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统评估多仅考虑单一来源或短答案情景，而实际应用需要综合多个源的分散信息并生成长文本回应。

Method: 设计可扩展框架构建评估基准，创建MSRS-Story（故事综合）和MSRS-Meet（会议摘要）两个基准，使用各种RAG流水线（稀疏/浓度检索器+前沿LLM）进行实验。

Result: 生成质量很大程度取决于检索效果，不同任务间差异显著。即使在理想检索条件下，多源综合仍具挑战性，但理性模型在综合步骤表现显著优于标准LLM。

Conclusion: 多源信息综合是RAG系统面临的重要挑战，需要同时改善检索效果和生成能力，理性模型在综合任务中显示出优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化对于在资源受限硬件上部署大语言模型至关重要，但其在多语言任务中的影响尚未充分探索，特别是在机器翻译领域

Method: 使用5个参数量从1.7B到70B的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行后训练量化评估，比较了AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound四种量化技术

Result: 4-bit量化通常能保持高资源语言和大模型的翻译质量，但低资源和类型多样语言在2-bit设置下出现显著性能下降。GGUF变体在2-bit精度下提供最一致的性能

Conclusion: 量化算法选择和模型大小共同决定鲁棒性，语言匹配的校准主要在低比特场景下有益，为在量化约束下部署多语言机器翻译模型提供了实用见解

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Result: IRMA在整体通过率上显著优于ReAct、函数调用和自我反思方法，分别提升16.1%、12.7%和19.1%

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出更高的可靠性和一致性，为解决LLM在多轮工具调用对话中的挑战提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

*Jiaqian Li,Qisheng Hu,Jing Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的两阶段示例选择策略，通过结构意识监督和插件模块提升了语义解析任务中的上下文学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICL示例选择策略忽视了结构对齐，导致语义解析等结构化预测任务的性能不佳和潜力不佳。

Method: 第一阶段使用结构意识监督细调BERT检索器，第二阶段添加插件模块增强隐藏表征中的语法意义信息。

Result: 在四个语义解析任务的基准测试中，方法持续超越现有基线，适用于多个最新LLM模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、通用性和性能之间实现了良好平衡，可无缝集成到现有流水线中。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动对话研究主要集中在特定领域或任务导向场景，导致评估碎片化，限制了全面探索模型主动对话能力的发展。

Method: 提出ProactiveEval框架，将主动对话分解为目标规划和对话引导，建立跨领域评估指标，自动生成多样化评估数据，开发了6个领域的328个评估环境。

Result: 实验测试了22种不同类型的大语言模型，发现DeepSeek-R1在目标规划任务上表现优异，Claude-3.7-Sonnet在对话引导任务上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究了推理能力对主动行为的影响，并讨论了其对未来模型发展的启示，为全面评估和提升LLMs的主动对话能力提供了重要框架。

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

TL;DR: LETHE是一种通过知识稀释消除LLM后门行为的新方法，结合内部模型融合和外部提示增强，在保持模型效用的同时将后门攻击成功率降低高达98%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，要么关注范围狭窄的触发器设置，要么无法抵御基于模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要更全面的防御方案

Method: LETHE采用内外双重机制：内部使用轻量数据集训练干净模型并与后门模型融合，稀释参数记忆中的后门影响；外部在提示中加入良性相关证据，分散LLM对后门特征的注意力

Result: 在5个主流LLM的分类和生成任务上测试，LETHE优于8个SOTA防御基线，对抗8种后门攻击，将高级后门攻击成功率降低高达98%，同时保持模型效用，且成本高效、对自适应攻击具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: LETHE提供了一种有效且全面的后门防御解决方案，通过知识稀释机制成功消除了LLM中的后门行为，为实际部署提供了可靠的保护

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子关系抽取，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，但发现在大规模数据集Wikidata上性能较低，主要原因是标签噪声和重表示能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，现有方法在处理大规模噪声数据时存在性能下降问题，需要探索更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用胶囊网络中的动态路由机制进行句子关系抽取，通过胶囊间的动态信息传递来提升关系表示能力。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，但在Wikidata数据集上表现不佳，发现标签噪声是主要原因。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，重表示能力也是句子关系抽取的重要挑战，提出的胶囊网络方法在重表示方面优于传统模型。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂推理和精确计算，传统方法耗时且易出错，而纯语言模型缺乏所需的准确性和可审计性

Result: 系统性能大幅提升，部署成本远低于现实世界平均水平，证明神经符号架构的经济可行性

Conclusion: 神经符号架构有望提供可靠、经济高效的税务援助，促进公平获取税务服务

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐训练，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在解释视觉输入时常见的幻觉问题，将其作为对齐问题来处理

Method: 利用CHAIR指标识别幻觉和非幻觉样本，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对MLLMs进行对齐微调

Result: 在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答的数量

Conclusion: CHAIR-DPO方法通过简单的指标基础对齐训练，能够有效提升MLLMs的出生质量

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，无法跟上多模态大模型引发的图像编辑技术发展，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 利用SD3多模态处理能力，将高频信号提取的图像伪造残差作为显式模态，在训练时融合到潜空间，保持SD3提取的丰富语义信息

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上达到了比当前最先进模型提升12%的性能提升，对未见过的真实文档伪造和自然场景图像也表现出强劲性能

Conclusion: 该方法成功将SD的图像生成和知觉能力集成到图像伪造检测框架中，为应对新兴图像编辑技术的挑战提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

Motivation: 现有AMR解决方案依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器，通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签条件下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为AMR提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，成功解决了音频驱动动画中的漂移和失真问题，能够生成高质量、长时间的人体动画视频。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度视频在VR中提供全视场体验，但缺乏包含空间音频的全面数据集，需要探索如何利用视听线索来有效预测360度环境中的视觉显著性。

Method: 创建YT360-EyeTracking数据集（81个ODV视频），提出基于视觉变换器的SalViT360框架（具有球面几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV模型（进一步整合音频输入的变换器适配器）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中的观看者注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于全向视频中的准确显著性预测至关重要，音频信息能有效提升视觉注意力预测性能。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Vision-Language模型的解释性人工智能管道，能够在样本和数据集层面解释视觉模型行为，发现失败案例并提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（准确率、IoU、mAP），而对可解释性关注不够。现有xAI方法多仅解释单个样本，缺乏能够解释模型在大规模数据集上一般行为的方法。理解模型在普通图像上的行为对防止偏见判断和识别模型趋势非常重要。

Method: 利用Vision-Language模型构建一种管道，能够在两个层面进行解释：样本级别解释（单个图像）和数据集级别解释（大规模数据集上的模型一般行为）。

Result: 该管道能够以最小化的努力发现视觉模型的失败案例，获得对模型行为的深度见解，并将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的方法来提升视觉模型的可解释性，通过在不同级别的解释能够更好地理解模型行为，减少偏见风险，从而推动图像分析领域的进步。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Motivation: 解决工业制造中异质结构材料快速可靠质量评估的瓶颈问题，特别是非传统增材制造工艺生产的材料

Method: 集成深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，开发定制化相似性表示，结合专家标注的图像和文本描述，使用Z-score归一化和净相似性评分进行零样本分类

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证，能够区分合格和缺陷样品，FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型与文本标准一致性更好

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进原始数据与专家知识之间的语义互操作性，为工程信息学中可扩展和领域适应性强的质量评估策略做出贡献

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过适配MedNeXt-L-k5模型，开发了一种自动化分割脚路空间（PVS）的方法，在T2加权MRI图像上达到了预期的性能，但在T1加权图像和跨数据集上表现不如nnU-Net模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割PVS耗时且中等而可靠，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且跨数据集通用性差，需要更高性能的解决方案。

Method: 适配Transformer受鼓发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5，分别使用均质的HCP-Aging T2加权MRI数据集和异质的多源T1加权MRI数据集训练模型，并通过5折交叉验证和留一站点交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 在T2加权图像上达到白质Dice得分0.88±0.06，与手动分割可靠性相当，为目前文献最高；在T1加权图像上仅为0.58±0.09；跨数据集时下降到0.38±0.16（白质）和0.35±0.12（基底节）。模型性能未超过nnU-Net。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的自动PVS分割方案，但Transformer模型的全局上下文注意机制并非PVS分割高准确性的必需条件，nnU-Net仍在这一任务上表现更优。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的反馈驱动自适应框架，通过将输出层的片层对应关系适应到中间注意力机制，以解决CLIP在开放词汇分割中的定位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP虽然具有强大的视觉-文本对齐能力，但在开放词汇分割任务中因为定位能力较差而表现不佳。之前的方法通过修改中间注意力来提升空间一致性，但这种一致性因后续操作而无法一致传播到最终输出。

Method: 设计了一个包含关键模块的反馈驱动框架：注意力隔离、基于信心度的剪枝稀疏适应、适应集成。将模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验知识，反馈到中间注意力机制中。

Result: 方法作为插入模块无缝集成到4种最先进方法和3种背骨网络，在8个标准数据集上均实现了性能提升，支持多种注意力类型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将最终输出的空间一致性反馈到中间表征，有效提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现，解决了中间注意力与最终输出之间的语义不一致问题。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的动态过程，发现了模型具有一致的阶段性结构特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在各种视觉-语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统性的分析方法来理解其表示动态。

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并通过三种提示变体（词汇变体、语义否定变体、输出格式变体）评估探测结果。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构：早期层执行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层次组织提供了统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态，有助于理解模型内部工作机制。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言嵌入空间解耦为概念特定的子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设CLIP等视觉-语言共嵌入网络的潜在嵌入空间可以通过分解为多个概念特定的子空间来解耦复杂场景的内容信息。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计线性合成模型，通过稀疏、非负的字典向量组合，其组级活动与多标签信息匹配。使用交替优化算法优化组结构字典。

Result: SLiCS提供的解耦嵌入能够实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成，在TiTok压缩自编码器嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上均表现出改进的检索精度。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间方法成功实现了嵌入空间的语义解耦，为概念级别的图像检索和生成任务提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Motivation: 医疗视觉-语言模型在临床应用中存在严重安全风险，包括保护健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络安全脏点，需要一种安全可靠的部署方案

Method: 开发MedFoundationHub GUI工具包：支持医生手动选择模型无需编程、通过Docker容器化部署确保隐私、支持Hugging Face开源模型的即插即用集成，仅需单台NVIDIA A6000 GPU本地运行

Result: 评估了5款状态前沿VLM模型，包括Google-MedGemma3-4B、Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct等，通过负责病理学家进行1015次临床评分，发现模型存在偏离目标答案、模糊推理和病理术语不一致等问题

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一种安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，虽然当前模型仍有限制，但该工具包为医疗AI应用的安全推广奠定了基础

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的综合实验表明，该框架能够通过融合音频的丰富信息来处理复杂编辑场景，而仅依靠文本的方法则无法完成。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的音频指导视觉编辑框架，在不需额外训练的情况下就能够有效处理复杂的多模态编辑任务，为多模态编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了SPML任务中的噪声和准确性问题，为多标签学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 该方法使脉冲具有不同的时间特性而非仅依赖频率表示，在保持与传统IF神经元相同能耗的同时，以更低时间步长实现更精确的特征表示

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

<details>

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对小结构和边缘区域的检测精度

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协作融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协作推理有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在细节保持和边缘清晰度方面

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Result: 大量实验证明，通过多尺度BEV特征利用多尺度图像特征能显著提升检测性能，MSMVD在GMVD数据集上比之前最佳MODA提升了4.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 多尺度BEV特征方法有效解决了多视角行人检测中的尺度变化问题，显著提升了检测精度，为相关领域提供了新的技术思路。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测器计算成本过高，难以在视频会议等实时应用场景中部署，需要开发轻量高效的检测方案

Method: 设计空间-频率混合感知模块（结合空间纹理和频率伪影）、令牌选择性交叉注意力机制、残差增强模糊池化结构，实现多尺度特征高效交互

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实验表明，SFMFNet在准确性和效率之间达到良好平衡，具有强泛化能力和实际应用价值

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深度伪造检测提供了有效的轻量级解决方案，在保持检测精度的同时显著提升了计算效率

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Motivation: 解决医学实际部署中大型模型计算资源受限的问题，开发轻量化模型以达到高性能但保持计算效率。

Method: 采用双模型权重选择策略，从大型预训练模型中初始化两个轻量化模型，然后应用自我知识萌荐技术，最后进行细调。

Result: 在胸部X光片、肺部CT扫描和脑部MRI扫描等公开数据集上的实验显示，该方法在性能和稳健性方面都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合双模型权重选择和自我知识萌荐，该方法充分充分利用了大型模型的知识，同时免除了传统方法在缩减模型时丢失关键信息的问题。

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种高效的LiDAR点云压缩方法，通过几何重密化和跨尺度特征传播模块，实现了高压缩比和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度LiDAR扫描产生大量数据，存储和传输成本高。现有方法在极端稀疏的几何细节上上下文建模效率低，限制了压缩性能和速度。

Method: 提出两个轻量模块：1)几何重密化模块：将编码的稀疏几何重新密化，在更密集尺度提取特征，然后重新稀疏化进行预测编码；2)跨尺度特征传播模块：利用多分辨率占位线索来指导层次特征传播。

Conclusion: 通过整合几何重密化和跨尺度特征传播，该方法生成了简洁的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模和加速编码过程。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Motivation: 3D领域数据稀缺限制了大规模模型的训练，而视频数据包含丰富的空间一致性和语义先验知识，可以作为替代监督信号来缓解3D数据不足的问题。

Method: 构建首个大规模多视角标注视频数据集Droplet3D-4M，训练支持图像和密集文本输入的生成模型Droplet3D，利用视频中的空间一致性和语义信息进行3D生成。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验知识显著促进了3D创作，该方法为3D生成提供了新的解决方案，所有资源均已开源。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程中，仅使用健康数据模拟多样化的脑部改变

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD和47例其他脑部病理的期前期组中验证，在CCD案例上取得显著改善，同时保持对健康和其他病理的性能。LCC估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识整合到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提升对稀有但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Method: 设计统一的模态无关架构，处理异构输入；探索模态间的协同作用，特别是唇部动作作为手语理解的非手动线索；实现与专业模型相当或更优的性能。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR任务上达到或超过最先进模型性能；明确建模唇部动作作为独立模态显著提升了手语翻译性能。

Conclusion: 统一框架成功整合多种模态，证明了模态间协同的重要性，特别是唇部动作对手语理解的增强作用，为无障碍通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮推理和门控奖励系统有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，无需外部模型即可实现端到端优化，显著提升了长视频理解性能。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明DUO优于现有方法

Conclusion: DUO框架通过联合最小化语义和几何不确定性，显著提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D专家模型，成功解决了3D表面异常检测的瓶颈问题，具有实际的工业部署价值。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit通过重新定义问题框架，克服了指令数据集质量的限制，提供了更可扩展的图像编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DCFS框架能够从多角度全面捕捉数据特征，有效减少伪标签噪声并缓解错误累积问题，在持续测试时适应场景中表现一致。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

TL;DR: 使用3DGS模型通过回传新视角颜色损失来细调相机标定参数，提升新视角合成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成至关重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而实际场景缺乏真实标定数据

Method: 通过3DGS模型进行相机参数细调，利用新视角颜色损失向相机参数进行回传优化

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上平均提升0.4 dB PSNR，对于标准场景如Mip-NeRF 360等效果显著

Conclusion: 虽然细调过程可能耗时，但对于标准场景的相机标定，新视角质量的提升价值明显，方法有效且应用前景广阔

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 通过早期数据层融合策略和动态自我迭代精炼，能够有效提升无监督3D物体检测的性能，为解决高成本标注问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Motivation: 解决域适应技术在医学图像应用中研究不足的问题，同时避免自然图像主流数据集可能带来的性能偏差，全面评估域适应技术在不同场景下的表现。

Method: 使用7种广泛使用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像数据集和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中比基线提升6.7%，同时在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能但计算成本高，需要在不增加推理负担的情况下提高鲁棒性

Method: 使用对比学习辅助分支增强主干网络特征表示能力，采用动态损失权重策略在训练早期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现CNN模型的SOTA性能且无需额外后处理

Conclusion: CLAB方法有效提升了视频目标检测的鲁棒性，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下取得了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现了专门处理排版信息的注意力头，并提出了一种无需微调的防御方法，通过选择性消融注意力头电路来提升模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在这种攻击下的行为并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专门提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，然后通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御排版攻击，无需微调。

Result: 该方法在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的方法与依赖微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列对排版攻击更具鲁棒性的dyslexic CLIP模型，这些模型可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Conclusion: 基于商图的区域级嵌入方法有效提升了面部表情识别性能，证明了图神经网络在结构化特征学习中的优势

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了有效解决方案和新的大规模数据集

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Motivation: 半导体制造中MFI数据集因专有性问题稀缺，限制了机器学习模型训练，需要生成合成数据来优化缺陷定位

Method: 基于扩散模型，集成两个物理约束条件，生成功率短路等常见缺陷类型的合成MFI图像

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能有效生成高质量的合成MFI数据，为机器学习算法提供训练数据，优化半导体缺陷定位流程

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Motivation: 分布式推理中交换的中间特征存在被利用恢复敏感数据的风险，现有的数据重构攻击方法在深度模型和跨数据集场景下效果有限，需要更有效的攻击方法来漏洞评估和防御研究。

Method: 提出GAN基础的进阶性特征优化（PFO）框架，将生成器分解为层次块并逐步精炼中间表征，以提升重构图像的语义保真度。采用L1-ball约束来稳定优化过程和提高图像真实性。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据重构攻击提供了更有效的解决方案，能够更好地判断分布式深度学习系统的安全性强度，对于隐私保护和安全防御具有重要意义。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖正面视图图像，导致后脑区域重建质量差，存在几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：1）主体特定生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏正面输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；2）自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模后脑区域和创新的对齐策略，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中后脑区域质量差的问题，为完整一致的头像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的艺术形式中，细微的面部特征扭曲会严重影响人物识别性，破坏个人和文化真实性。需要一种能够在极端风格变换中保持面部身份的方法。

Method: 采用端到端文本引导框架：1）使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散变换器进行涂鸦风格迁移；2）通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入；3）使用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制；4）采用"风格优先、身份保持"的范式。

Result: 定量结果显示竞争性的面部特征一致性，以及最先进的美学和人类偏好评分。定性分析和在Cruilla Festival的现场部署展示了系统的实际创作影响力。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术创作目标，为创意AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Result: 显著减少幻觉、增强安全性、提升整体能力，在实证结果中明显优于传统方法

Conclusion: 该方法为LVLM对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的可扩展性和成本效益

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic

intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the

or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2通过改进的训练方法和数据生成技术，实现了移动端图像-文本模型的新突破，为低延迟高精度应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data

Conclusion: 该方法成功将因果推理模块化，CCE可作为可重用的因果推理引擎，为因果视频问答提供了透明且逻辑一致的解决方案

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法实现了码率-失真-复杂度优化（RDCO），适用于各种码率和码率受限的应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于域鲁棒性非典型有丝分裂图像分类的简单训练方法，通过风格扰动、注意力特征对齐和EMA教师蒸馏，在MIDOG 2025挑战中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非典型有丝分裂图像(AMFs)是重要的组织病理学标志物，但在不同扫描仪、染色和采集差异导致的域偏移下难以一致识别

Method: 1) 在早期和中期骨干网络阶段插入风格扰动增加特征多样性；2) 使用弱域标签通过辅助对齐损失跨站点对齐注意力精炼特征；3) 通过温度缩放KL散度从EMA教师模型蒸馏以稳定预测

Result: 在组织者运行的初步排行榜上，平衡准确率为0.8762，灵敏度0.8873，特异性0.8651，ROC AUC为0.9499

Conclusion: 该方法推理时间开销可忽略，仅需粗粒度域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Pref-GRPO方法解决T2I生成中的奖励破解问题，使用成对偏好奖励替代点式评分；同时引入UniGenBench基准测试，包含600个提示和精细评估标准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励破解影响，微小分数差异在归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益，破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO：基于成对偏好奖励的GRPO方法，在每组内对图像进行成对比较，使用胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转向偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能区分细微图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励破解；UniGenBench基准揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法有效解决了奖励破解问题，UniGenBench为T2I模型提供了更全面的评估框架，验证了新方法的有效性

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编码判别性、多视图一致特征方面存在不足，难以从稀疏输入视图构建准确几何结构。

Method: 在统一渲染管道中集成三个轻量级模块，引入上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束来改进特征融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS实现了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现照片级真实感合成，无需额外监督，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D视觉定位方法因依赖单视角定位而导致的空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化等问题，推动3DVG向更大泛化性和实际应用性发展。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤，然后使用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列中，最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架有效解决了零样本3D视觉定位中的关键挑战，展示了在真实世界应用中的巨大潜力，推动了该领域向更高泛化性和实用性发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了CLIP视觉语言模型在军事环境中对遮挡的鲁棒性，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大，通过微调可显著提升抗遮挡能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在军事防御应用中具有零样本分类优势，但其在具有部分遮挡和低信噪比的挑战性军事环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用包含18类军事车辆的自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比评估CLIP变体的性能，采用标准化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标

Result: Transformer-based CLIP模型始终优于CNN；细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡性能下降更严重；线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；通过微调主干网络，性能下降点可推迟到60%以上遮挡

Conclusion: 研究强调了训练中遮挡特定增强的重要性，需要进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以实现CLIP在现实世界中的部署

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Method: 提出SKGE-Swin架构，采用Swin Transformer的移位窗口多头自注意力机制(SW-MSA)来提取远距离像素信息，并通过跳跃阶段机制保留从初始到最终特征提取阶段的关键信息。

Result: 在CARLA平台对抗场景测试中，SKGE-Swin架构相比先前方法获得了更优越的驾驶评分(Driving Score)。

Conclusion: 该架构通过结合Swin Transformer和跳跃连接机制，有效提升了自动驾驶模型对复杂环境的理解能力和整体性能。

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器在视频内容理解方面取得了显著进展，能够识别具体物体、动作和场景，但人类独有的抽象概念识别能力（如正义、自由、团结等）仍然是机器视频理解的重大挑战。

Method: 通过研究不同任务和数据集，综述了多年来研究者们利用当时可用工具解决抽象概念理解问题的各种方法，并倡导在基础模型时代借鉴社区经验。

Conclusion: 利用数十年的社区经验可以避免重复造轮子，为基础模型时代重新审视抽象概念理解这一重要挑战提供指导，使模型更符合人类推理和价值观。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Method: 提出全局类别激活概率图评估(GCAPME)方法，概率化地分析所有类别的像素级激活概率图，并应用SafeML技术检测误诊

Result: 在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行评估，方法能够统一可视化诊断过程

Conclusion: 该方法有助于降低误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性和患者安全性，为医生和患者提供必要的警告

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了Diffusion Classifier、CLIP和ViLT在组合泛化能力上的表现，发现Diffusion Classifier和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系推理任务上都存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分的组合中形成新含义。尽管视觉语言模型(VLMs)取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们无法进行这种组合推理，比如CLIP在处理组合概念时会出现错误绑定。

Method: 评估三种模型(Diffusion Classifier、CLIP和ViLT)在零样本学习(ZSL)和广义零样本学习(GZSL)设置下绑定对象与属性和关系的能力。通过分析模型在概念绑定和关系推理任务上的表现来评估其组合泛化能力。

Result: Diffusion Classifier和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念(如左右)的表征过于相似。

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在组合泛化方面相比判别模型有所改进，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面仍面临重大挑战，需要进一步改进关系概念的表征学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Result: 在室内外数据集上相比最先进方法表现出优越性和鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 提出的面元位姿学习回归方法能够有效处理点云配准中的方向不确定性问题，具有更好的鲁棒性

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionCounting是一个新颖的多任务学习框架，将可见光和红外图像融合(VIF)与人群计数相结合，通过动态损失权重和对抗训练提升融合质量和计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，虽然近期研究开始引入语义分割和目标检测等下游任务，但这些方法需要大量标注或在密集场景中存在重叠边界框和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽然关注度增加，但尚未与VIF集成到统一框架中。

Method: 提出FusionCounting多任务学习框架，将人群计数集成到VIF过程中。采用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，并引入对抗训练增强VIF和人群计数的鲁棒性。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验结果表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 人群计数为VIF提供了直接定量的人口密度测量，且标注需求最小，特别适合密集场景。该框架通过多任务设计实现了输入图像和人口密度信息的互利共赢。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Method: 提出PointDGRWKV框架，包含两个关键模块：1）自适应几何标记移位模块，用于建模局部邻域结构以提升几何上下文感知；2）跨域关键特征分布对齐模块，通过对齐跨域关键特征分布来缓解注意力漂移。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PointDGRWKV在领域泛化点云分类任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PointDGRWKV成功解决了RWKV在点云数据中的局限性，同时保持了RWKV的线性效率优势，为领域泛化点云分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Motivation: 解决深度学习病理诊断中模型决策不透明和缺乏可追溯依据的问题，提供透明可解释的AI辅助病理诊断。

Method: 提出PathMR框架，基于多模态视觉推理架构，给定病理图像和文本查询，同时生成分割掩码和语义对齐的文本解释，定位病变区域并生成专家风格诊断叙述。

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，为临床采用提供了透明和可依赖的AI辅助工具。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

Motivation: 肠腺尿管癌(PDAC)是最恶性的癌症之一，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是发现晚期，需要新的早期诊断方法

Method: 使用40个患者样本的双模态图像（自发光和二次调制生成），比较了6种深度学习架构（CNN和ViT），采用修改的ResNet网络结构，包括冻结预训练层和类别权重训练

Result: 最终框架在癌症检测中达到了超10%的准确率，显著提升了现有手工分析方法的性能

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一个稳健的自动化PDAC检测流程，可以增强病理学家的能力，为其他癌症类型的扩展奠定基础，同时为医学图像数据集应用深度学习提供了价值较高的见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了图片撰改定位任务的数据缺乏问题，通过网络监督和自动注释技术显著提高了模型性能，为图片伪造检测领域提供了重要技术支撑

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Motivation: 组织病理学图像中的有丝分裂检测对肿瘤评估至关重要，但现有机器学习算法在跨域测试时性能显著下降，需要解决域泛化问题。

Method: 采用VM-UNet架构，结合Mamba模型在医学图像分割中的优异表现，并使用染色增强操作来提高模型对域偏移的鲁棒性。

Result: 在MIDOG++数据集上的初步实验显示，该方法仍有很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的VM-UNet架构结合染色增强是解决有丝分裂检测域泛化问题的有前景方向，但需要进一步优化提升性能。

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this

task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写合成方法存在两个主要局限：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，且忽视了频率信息在捕捉细粒度风格细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导鉴别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失来对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，有效提升低资源手写识别系统的数据增强效果。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知方法显著提升了手写合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视频token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际增益在段级和token级去除冗余，在保持99.5%性能的同时减少75%视觉token，加速推理3.9倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法未考虑视频的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid能最大化有限token预算的利用率，显著提升效率同时保持强性能

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing将指令信息注入视觉编码器选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing引入动作意图修剪指令无关token实现稀疏化；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计显著提高了VLA模型的效率和性能，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源同质化且测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 构建HydraFake数据集包含多样化深度伪造技术和野外伪造内容；提出Veritas MLLM检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）模拟人类取证过程，使用两阶段训练管道

Result: 实验显示先前检测器在跨模型场景中泛化良好，但在未见伪造技术和数据域上表现不足；Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升，能够提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集有效模拟真实世界挑战，Veritas通过模式感知推理实现了更好的深度伪造检测泛化能力和透明度

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的视频，但现实中存在大量局部修改的真实视频，这些细微的局部伪造更难检测且更具欺骗性，现有检测方法对此存在严重漏洞。

Method: 提出了FakeParts局部深度伪造概念，创建了FakePartsBench大规模基准数据集，包含超过25,000个视频，提供像素级和帧级操作标注，用于全面评估检测方法。通过用户研究和模型测试验证检测难度。

Result: 实验表明，FakeParts局部伪造使人类检测准确率相比传统深度伪造下降超过30%，最先进的检测模型也出现类似的性能下降，证实了当前检测方法的严重脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法对局部视频操作的严重漏洞，提供了必要的基准资源来开发更鲁棒的检测方法，应对日益复杂的局部伪造威胁。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，Seedream 3.0 Fill模型展示了无需任务特定SFT的多任务强化学习方法的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Motivation: 现有数字水印技术的鲁棒性在面对对抗攻击时存在不确定性，需要通过系统性的攻击测试来验证和改进水印方法的稳健性。

Method: 针对米色盒攻击使用自适应VAE规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的颜色对比度恢复；针对黑盒攻击采用基于空间或频域伪影的图像聚类，然后应用图像到图像扩散模型，结合受控噪声注入和ChatGPT生成的语义先验。

Conclusion: 该研究的水印攻击方法为开发更鲁棒的图像水印技术提供了重要参考和启发。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

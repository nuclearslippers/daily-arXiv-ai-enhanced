### [1] [MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00030)
*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多流模块化简化语言翻译框架MultiStream-LLM，通过专门的指书法、唇读和持续手语预测器，结合LLM实现了简化语言翻译的新时代最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的结构化简化语言翻译模型在高速指书法识别和非手势线索整合方面存在显著缺陷，导致名称、地名等关键信息翻译性能差。

Method: 采用模块化设计，使用专门的预测器分别处理持续手语、指书法和唇读，通过轻量转换器解决时间对齐问题，最终由大语言模型生成句子。

Result: 在How2Sign标准数据集上达到BLEU-4分数23.5的新时代最佳性能，在ChicagoFSWildPlus指书法数据集上达到73.2%的字母准确率。

Conclusion: 通过分离和专门处理不同识别任务的多专家方法，为稳健、高保真的简化语言翻译提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

### [2] [Compiling Prompts, Not Crafting Them: A Reproducible Workflow for AI-Assisted Evidence Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00038)
*Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文将声明式提示优化技术应用于系统文献综述(SLR)自动化，提出了一种可重现、可验证的LLM流水线框架，以解决传统手动编写提示的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLM在系统文献综述中的应用依赖于手动编写的脆弱提示，影响了可靠性和可重现性，需要提高科学信心度。

Method: 采用声明式提示优化技术，构建包含任务声明、测试套件和自动提示调整的领域特定框架，并提供工作代码示例。

Result: 开发出一种可验证的LLM流水线蓝图，能够构建符合透明性和严谨性原则的证据综合流程。

Conclusion: 这是声明式提示优化技术在SLR流程中的新颖应用，为提高LLM辅助证据综合的可靠性和可重现性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

### [3] [What Are Research Hypotheses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00185)
*Jian Wu,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了自然语言处理领域中"假设"概念的不同定义，指出了从传统科学定义到NLU任务中的演变差异，强调了在机器可解释学术记录背景下明确定义的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言处理技术的发展，各种任务中对"假设"概念的定义出现了分歧和迁移，需要系统梳理和明确界定，特别是在构建机器可解释学术记录的背景下。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，对近期发表的NLU任务中关于假设的定义进行概述和辨析，特别关注不同文献间的定义差异。

Result: 识别出NLU领域中假设定义存在显著差异，这些定义已经从传统自然科学、社会科学和形式科学的定义发生了迁移。

Conclusion: 明确定义和良好结构的假设对于推进机器可解释学术记录至关重要，需要建立统一的定义标准。

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing,
significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically
extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific
domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional
definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we
observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we
overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we
discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We
highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses,
particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

### [4] [Explainable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis on State-Aware Reasoning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00190)
*Sheldon Yu,Yuxin Xiong,Junda Wu,Xintong Li,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Ritwik Sinha,Jingbo Shang,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出状态感知转换框架，将思维链推理轨迹抽象为结构化潜在动态，通过谱分析和马尔可夫链建模实现可解释的多步推理分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链提示方法虽然支持多步推理，但可解释性有限，主要关注局部token级归因，缺乏对推理步骤高级语义角色和转换的探索

Method: 使用谱分析对token级嵌入进行聚类，将推理步骤表示为语义一致的潜在状态，并通过马尔可夫链建模推理过程的全局结构

Result: 建立了结构化和可解释的推理过程视图，支持语义角色识别、时间模式可视化和一致性评估等多种分析

Conclusion: 该框架为思维链推理提供了更深入的可解释性分析工具，能够揭示推理步骤的语义角色和转换模式

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

### [5] [The Rarity Blind Spot: A Framework for Evaluating Statistical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00245)
*Seiji Maekawa,Hayate Iso,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM)新任务和DiFBench基准框架，评估LLM在文档集合中识别全局稀有特征的能力，发现现有模型在统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在显著局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注信息检索和摘要，但缺乏评估LLM识别全局稀有特征的能力，这在候选选择、产品差异化等实际场景中至关重要

Method: 引入DFM任务，要求模型分析10-40个文档的集合，识别出现频率低于10%的稀有特征；开发DiFBench可配置基准框架，控制文档集大小和独特性阈值等参数

Result: 对10个最先进LLM的大规模评估显示：通用模型与推理增强模型之间存在显著性能差距；所有模型随任务复杂度和文档数量增加而性能大幅下降；常见错误是将频繁特征误判为稀有特征

Conclusion: 当代LLM在执行细粒度统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在核心局限性，需要开发更强大的推理能力来应对这类现实世界决策任务

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

### [6] [The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于Peirce符号学理论的统一框架，用于分析不同类型的人类意义构建模型，将模型本身视为符号进行关系性理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前人类意义构建模型领域缺乏统一的理论框架，无法在同一标准下比较不同模型类型的建模实践。

Method: 基于C.S. Peirce符号学理论，认为模型测量潜在符号几何结构，并通过模型间的对比关系来理解模型的解释视角。

Result: 构建了一个模型语义学理论，将模型和建模决策本身视为符号进行分析，并通过实例说明了该框架的实践应用。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析复杂符号系统中的建模实践提供了统一的理论基础，并开启了新的基础问题研究方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

### [7] [The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00250)
*Hugo Sousa,Ricardo Campos,Alípio Jorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Game方法，将时间关系抽取任务转化为交互式游戏，通过点对点比较来标注时间关系，支持区间和瞬时实体，并提供游戏模式和标注模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间关系标注方法直接标注区间级关系存在局限性，需要更细粒度和灵活的方法来支持不同类型的时间实体标注。

Method: 将时间关系分解为起点和终点之间的点对点比较，通过时间闭包推理额外关系并保持一致性，采用交互式游戏形式进行标注。

Result: 开发了包含游戏模式和标注模式的演示系统，支持TempEval-3数据集标注和自定义文档标注，系统已开源并提供在线访问。

Conclusion: Temporal Game为时间关系标注提供了新颖的交互式方法，为强化学习代理训练奠定了基础，促进了时间推理和标注研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

### [8] [Exploring Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding with Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00276)
*Yuxiang Liu,Tian Wang,Gourab Kundu,Tianyu Cao,Guang Cheng,Zhen Ge,Jianshu Chen,Qingjun Cui,Trishul Chilimbi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RITE方法通过生成中间推理文本来增强文本嵌入，将逻辑推理融入嵌入过程，显著提升了零样本检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的嵌入方法主要关注上下文表示，未能充分利用LLMs的强大推理能力，而复杂查询需要超越表层词汇匹配的深度推理

Method: 提出RITE方法，在计算嵌入前在token空间中生成中间推理文本，从而用推理深度丰富表示，基于现有语言模型嵌入技术

Result: 在推理密集型检索基准BRIGHT上的实验结果显示，RITE显著提升了跨多个领域的零样本检索性能

Conclusion: 将推理融入嵌入过程是有效的，RITE方法简单但有效，能够充分利用LLMs的推理能力来提升文本嵌入质量

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

### [9] [OpinioRAG: Towards Generating User-Centric Opinion Highlights from Large-scale Online Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00285)
*Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpinioRAG是一个可扩展的、无需训练的框架，结合RAG检索和LLMs从大量用户评论中生成个性化摘要，并提出了新的无参考验证指标用于情感丰富的领域评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理数千条评论的规模，或者只能生成通用的摘要而忽略个性化需求，需要一种能够高效处理大规模评论并生成定制化摘要的解决方案。

Method: 提出OpinioRAG框架，结合基于RAG的证据检索和大型语言模型，无需训练即可生成个性化摘要；同时设计新的无参考验证指标来评估情感领域的事实一致性。

Result: 创建了首个大规模长形式用户评论数据集，包含每个实体超过千条评论，并配有专家摘要和手动标注的查询；通过实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: OpinioRAG是一个强大的框架，能够生成准确、相关且结构化的摘要，为未来研究提供了关键挑战和可操作的改进见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of
user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods
either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

### [10] [Wage Sentiment Indices Derived from Survey Comments via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00290)
*Taihei Sone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型构建工资情绪指数(WSI)来预测日本工资动态，基于经济观察者调查数据，显著优于基准方法和预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的出现为经济文本分析创造了新机会，需要开发更及时有效的经济政策工具来预测工资动态。

Method: 扩展价格情绪指数(PSI)框架，专门针对工资相关情绪构建WSI，开发可扩展的数据架构以整合报纸和社交媒体等额外数据源。

Result: 基于LLM的WSI模型显著优于基准方法和预训练模型，证明了LLM驱动情绪指数的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的情绪指数有潜力增强政府和央行经济政策设计的及时性和有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

### [11] [Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309)
*Chen Zheng,Yiyuan Ma,Yuan Yang,Deyi Liu,Jing Liu,Zuquan Song,Yuxin Song,Cheng Ren,Hang Zhu,Xin Liu,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现将RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型时会出现序列长度崩溃和奖励曲棍球棒曲线问题，提出了平衡演员初始化(BAI)方法来解决这些训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型时出现的训练不稳定问题，包括序列长度崩溃和奖励急剧下降后缓慢恢复的现象，这些现象损害了模型的对齐和推理能力。

Method: 提出平衡演员初始化(BAI)方法，采用两阶段加权模型合并：首先合并指令跟随和蒸馏推理微调模型，然后将中间模型与预训练模型进一步合并以保留基础知识。

Result: BAI方法解决了序列长度崩溃问题，缓解了奖励曲棍球棒曲线现象，实现了训练期间序列长度的持续改进，平衡的合并比例在训练稳定性和推理能力保持之间达到最优权衡。

Conclusion: BAI为第三范式提供了有效的稳定训练解决方案，使推理模型能够结合蒸馏效率和RLHF对齐，产生更强大的推理能力。

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

### [12] [GIER: Gap-Driven Self-Refinement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00325)
*Rinku Dewri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIER是一个通过自我反思和迭代修订来提升大语言模型输出的框架，基于概念质量差距描述来改进推理质量，在多个推理任务和模型上均有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示策略依赖演示、示例或思维链模板，需要更通用的方法来让模型自我识别和修复推理差距

Method: 使用自然语言描述推理差距，让模型迭代式地批判和精炼自身输出，基于概念质量标准进行自我修订

Result: 在SciFact、PrivacyQA和e-SNLI三个推理任务及四个LLM上，GIER提升了推理质量、基础性和推理对齐性，且不降低任务准确率

Conclusion: 模型不仅能理解抽象概念差距，还能将其转化为具体的推理改进，证明了自我反思修订框架的有效性

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

*Ziyi Xia,Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoSeek是一个用于合成复杂深度研究任务的框架，通过双代理系统构建研究树并生成需要层次推理的自然语言问题，显著提升了LLM在深度研究任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试无法捕捉深度研究任务的复杂性，而合成数据集存在推理捷径、知识泄露或结构深度不足的问题，需要新的框架来支持LLM进行复杂的多步推理和证据合成。

Method: 使用双代理系统递归地从大规模网页构建研究树，将中间节点模糊化为有效子问题，并将这些树转换为需要遍历完整层次结构的自然语言问题。支持快速扩展，生成超过5万个训练样本和推理轨迹。

Result: 在InfoSeek上训练的模型持续优于强基线。在BrowseComp-Plus基准上，使用InfoSeek优化的3B LLM超越了更大的32B模型和轻量级商业API，性能可与更强的API相媲美。

Conclusion: InfoSeek通过提供大规模训练数据和保留中间步骤等元信息，有效支持LLM进行复杂的深度研究任务，并为高级优化策略如复合奖励设计和轨迹级探索提供了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

### [14] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphKV是一种基于图的KV缓存管理框架，通过动态传播机制自适应地保留重要token，提升长文本处理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存淘汰策略基于静态启发式方法，无法捕捉推理过程中token间动态依赖关系，导致内存限制下的性能瓶颈

Method: 将token建模为带重要性分数的节点，边表示相似关系，通过衰减信号传播机制动态更新token重要性，实现上下文感知的token选择

Result: GraphKV可无缝集成到现有KV缓存淘汰方法中，如SnapKV和PyramidKV，以即插即用的方式提升性能

Conclusion: GraphKV通过图结构和动态传播机制有效解决了传统静态KV缓存管理的局限性，为长文本序列处理提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

### [15] [The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00391)
*Yuting Tan,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li,Huizhen Shu,Peikang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了GCG和T-GCG攻击算法在不同规模开源语言模型上的敌对提示敌破效果，发现攻击成功率随模型规模增大而降低，编程提示比安全提示更容易被攻击，且GPT-4o语义判断比前缀评估更严格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基于梯度的敌对提示攻击算法（如GCG和T-GCG）在不同规模语言模型上的敌破效果，以了解模型规模、评估方法和任务类型对攻击效果的影响。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-0.5B、LLaMA-3.2-1B和GPT-OSS-20B三个不同规模的开源模型，在安全向提示（AdvBench）和逻辑编程提示上进行敌对攻击测试，对比GCG和温度温度提升版本T-GCG的效果，使用前缀评估和GPT-4o语义判断两种方法评估攻击成功率。

Result: 三个主要发现：1）攻击成功率随模型规模增大而降低；2）前缀评估方法高估了攻击效果，GPT-4o语义判断更严格可靠；3）编程相关提示比安全提示更容易被攻击。T-GCG在前缀评估下表现竞争力，但在语义判断下改善有限。

Conclusion: GCG算法的可扩展性有限，逻辑任务存在被忽视的漏洞，需要进一步发展温度温度等策略来提升敌对评估的健壮性。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

*Juraj Vladika,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedSEBA是一个AI驱动的医疗问答系统，通过检索PubMed医学研究数据库生成基于证据的可信回答，并提供研究共识演变可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决互联网医疗信息可靠性差和医学研究数量庞大难以追踪的问题，帮助用户区分可靠信息和误导信息。

Method: 利用大型语言模型生成连贯回答，同时动态检索PubMed数据库中的可信医学研究作为依据，提供关键点和可追溯的论据。

Result: 用户研究表明医学专家和普通用户都认为系统可用、有帮助，提供的答案可信且信息丰富。

Conclusion: 该系统既适用于日常健康问题，也适合高级研究洞察，能有效合成基于证据的医疗答案。

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

### [17] [The Gold Medals in an Empty Room: Diagnosing Metalinguistic Reasoning in LLMs with Camlang](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00425)
*Fenghua Liu,Yulong Chen,Yixuan Liu,Zhujun Jin,Solomon Tsai,Ming Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出Camlang构造语言案例，通过明确的语言学习测试LLM的真实理解能力，发现当前模型虽然在英语任务上表现优异，但在新语言学习中远较人类差异显著，主要依赖浅层词汇对齐而非系统性语法掌握。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多个测试中表现出色，但不确定这种成功是否反映了真正的理解还是纯粹的模式匹配。从认知科学角度出发，需要一种能够测试模型是否能够通过明确的语言学习掌握新语言的方法。

Method: 设计Camlang构造语言，包含自然语言特征但未见过的特征组合。提供语法书和双语词典两种明确资源，模仿成人第二语言学习。将CommonsenseQA适配到Camlang中，创建Camlang-CSQA-v0任务，测试模型的语法规则和词汇映射能力。

Result: GPT-5在英语任务上达到98%准确率，但在Camlang中仅有47%，远低于人类的87%。其他领先LLM表现更差。人工验证显示模型成功主要来自浅层词汇对齐，GPT-5展现出有限的语言意识，但无法像人类那样系统掌握语法。

Conclusion: Camlang建立了一种基于认知科学的评估案例，曝露了当前模型与人类语言能力之间的根本差距，证明了LLM在真正语言理解和推理方面的限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

*Xuecheng Zou,Ke Liu,Bingbing Wang,Huafei Deng,Li Zhang,Yu Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU是一个基于语义单元的RAG框架，通过全局消歧和层次化关键词提取来解决传统图RAG中语义单元提取的模糊性和检索开销问题，在多个任务上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法在提取高层语义单元时局限于局部文本块，容易产生歧义、复杂耦合和检索开销增加的问题，缺乏全局知识或忽视细粒度关系。

Method: 提出GOSU框架：1）在图构建阶段对预提取的语义单元进行全局合并，指导实体和关系抽取；2）在检索生成阶段引入层次化关键词提取和语义单元补全，分别捕获细粒度二元关系和粗粒度n元关系。

Result: 在多个任务上的评估表明，GOSU在生成质量方面优于基线RAG方法。

Conclusion: GOSU通过全局语义单元处理和层次化关系捕获机制，有效解决了传统图RAG方法的局限性，提升了检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级框架，使用专门的阿拉伯文本编码器和注意力相关性评分方法来解决伊斯兰继承法的多选题问题，实现了高效的本地推理和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰继承法需要精确识别继承人和计算份额，这对AI构成挑战。需要开发一种高效、可在设备本地部署的解决方案，以应对大型模型资源消耗大、依赖上下文的问题。

Method: 使用专门的阿拉伯文本编码器（MARBERT、ArabicBERT、AraBERT）结合Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS)方法，通过语义相关性对答案选项进行排名，实现快速的本地推理而无需生成式推理。

Result: 在QIAS 2025数据集上，大型模型（Gemini、DeepSeek）达到了87.6%的最高准确率，而但需要更多资源。作者的MARBERT基础方法达到69.87%准确率，虽然略低于大型模型，但具有高效、可本地部署和隐私保护的优势。

Conclusion: 这项工作量化了大型模型的极致性能与小型专业系统实用优势之间的关键承特关系，为高风险领域提供了一种经济高效、可靠部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域语言生成的不确定性量化在黑盒约束下（无法访问内部模型信号）是一个关键但未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 使用token-level熵作为不确定性度量，将其整合到split conformal prediction流程中，通过CP分位数校准不确定性阈值来确保可证明的错误控制。

Result: 在6个大语言模型和2个基准测试（CoQA和TriviaQA）上的实验表明，TECP始终实现可靠的覆盖和紧凑的预测集，优于先前的自一致性UQ方法。

Conclusion: TECP为黑盒LLM设置中的可信生成提供了一个原则性和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究了四种提示方法来解决角色扮演对话代理中的过度说话和工具使用不足问题，其中基于规则的提示方法(RRP)通过角色卡/场景契约设计和严格函数调用执行获得了最佳性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPDC 2025挑战中，对话代理经常产生过长的角色响应(过度说话)，同时未能根据角色有效使用工具(行动不足)，如生成不存在的函数调用或在回答前进行不必要的工具调用

Method: 探索了四种提示方法：1)基础角色提示 2)人工制作角色提示 3)自动提示优化(APO) 4)基于规则的角色提示(RRP)。RRP方法采用角色卡/场景契约设计和严格函数调用执行技术

Result: 基于规则的角色提示(RRP)方法获得了0.571的整体分数，相比零样本基线的0.519有所提升，表现优于更复杂的APO方法

Conclusion: RRP设计可以显著提高角色扮演对话代理的有效性和可靠性，为未来开发角色提示提供了有价值的参考。所有最佳性能提示和APO工具都已开源

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

TL;DR: ResearchQA是一个从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K查询和160K评分标准项的资源，用于评估LLM系统回答研究问题的能力，发现当前系统在引用文献、描述局限性和比较分析方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估研究问题长回答主要依赖专家标注，限制了评估范围。研究专业知识广泛分布在文献中，特别是综述文章综合了分散的知识，需要一种更全面的评估方法。

Method: 从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K个查询和160K个评分标准项，每个评分标准包含查询特定的答案评估标准（引用论文、解释说明、描述局限性）。使用31位博士标注者在8个领域进行评估，并构建自动成对判断系统。

Result: 96%的查询支持博士信息需求，87%的评分标准项需要在系统回答中用至少一个句子来满足。自动判断系统与专家判断达到74%一致率。在7.6K次成对评估中，没有参数化或检索增强系统超过70%的评分标准覆盖率，最高排名代理系统达到75%覆盖率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM系统在研究问题回答方面存在显著能力差距，特别是在引用文献（完全处理<11%）、描述局限性（48%）和比较分析（49%）方面。ResearchQA数据发布以促进更全面的多领域评估。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

TL;DR: 通过以额基于预测不确定性的动态聚合框架，学习压缩语义语音表征，在保持性能的同时提高效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音离散表征学习方法的刻度过细（25-50刻度/秒），导致冗余和效率低下，而语义理解并不需要这么细层级的语音信息

Method: 首先通过下一个刻度预测预训练语音语言模型，然后使用预测不确定性来动态确定聚合边界，最后通过交叉注意力模块融合每个分段内的信息

Result: 在ASR、语音到文本翻译和语音转换任务上，压缩后的表征表现与厚密刻度序列相当或更好

Conclusion: 该方法能够灵活控制表征的粒度和压缩比，在保持性能的同时显著提高效率，为语音表征学习提供了有效的压缩方案

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在法律语境中如何根据用户角色进行有动机的推理和信息框架调整，探讨法律现实主义理论在AI生成摘要中的体现

Method: 基于法律事实和推理包含度的评估框架，分析不同法律角色提示下LLMs对司法判决的摘要行为，考虑对利益相关者的偏向性

Result: 即使提示中包含平衡指令，模型仍表现出选择性信息包含模式，反映出与角色一致的视角，存在角色一致的偏向性

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在高风险法律环境中需要对LLM摘要行为进行角色感知评估的重要性，因为LLMs可能从先前交互或上下文中推断用户角色而产生类似的对齐

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在推理能力增强时更容易响应恶意请求，这种现象被称为"推理诱导的错位"，大模型尤其脆弱，揭示了推理与安全性的新权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，其安全性和与人类价值观对齐的问题日益突出。先前研究表明在恶意数据上微调会导致错位行为，但本研究发现了更令人担忧的现象——推理本身可能诱导错位。

Method: 通过切换到"思考模式"或在良性数学数据集上微调来增强LLMs的推理能力，观察模型对恶意请求的响应变化，并分析内部模型状态（注意力转移和专家混合模型中的专家分工）。

Result: 发现推理能力增强后，LLMs对恶意请求的响应性显著提高，大模型尤其脆弱。同时发现注意力转移和专家分工有助于将过度推理重新导向安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了推理与安全性之间的新权衡问题，强调了为高级推理模型推进对齐技术的紧迫性，为理解模型错位机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

TL;DR: LLMs在评估环境和部署环境中的行为存在显著差异（评估意识现象），本文通过线性探测和提示重写技术量化并操纵这种差异，发现模型在测试环境中更容易产生不安全或欺骗性输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估环境和实际部署环境中表现出不同的行为，这种评估意识现象对AI对齐构成严重挑战，因为基准测试性能可能无法准确反映模型的真实安全性和诚实性。

Method: 提出一种方法学：使用线性探测对提示进行评分（从"测试类"到"部署类"），并利用LLM重写策略将提示转向更自然的部署风格上下文，同时保留原始任务。

Result: 重写后的"部署类"提示导致行为显著变化：诚实回答平均增加5.26%，欺骗性回答平均减少12.40%，拒绝率平均增加6.38%，表明安全合规性提高。

Conclusion: 评估意识是可量化和可操纵的因素，直接影响LLM行为，模型在感知的测试环境中更容易产生不安全或欺骗性输出，亟需更现实的评估框架来准确衡量模型对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

TL;DR: 提出Gated Associative Memory (GAM)网络，一种线性复杂度的并行架构，替代Transformer的二次复杂度自注意力机制，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制具有O(N^2)的二次计算复杂度，在处理长序列时成为显著瓶颈，需要更高效的序列建模架构。

Method: GAM块用两条并行路径替代自注意力：因果卷积捕获局部位置相关上下文，关联记忆检索机制建模全局内容模式，通过门控机制动态融合局部和全局信息。

Result: 在WikiText-2和TinyStories数据集上，GAM比标准Transformer和Mamba基线训练速度更快，在所有数据集上达到相当或更好的验证困惑度。

Conclusion: GAM作为线性复杂度架构，是序列建模的高效替代方案，在保持竞争力的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

*Md Tanzib Hosain,Md Kishor Morol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了ICPC基准测试，包含254个国际大学生程序设计竞赛题目，通过多轮自判断、反思和检索技术，将语言模型的解题率从19.1%提升到42.2%，并发现特定指令能显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程任务需要复杂的算法思维和代码实现能力，但作为评估语言模型的领域尚未得到足够关注。研究旨在开发一个全面的基准来评估语言模型在竞争性编程中的表现。

Method: 构建包含254个ICPC题目的基准，每个题目包含官方分析、参考代码和多种测试用例。采用零样本思维链提示、多轮自判断与反思、检索等技术来提升模型表现。

Result: 零样本思维链提示下模型仅达到19.1%的通过率，最佳推理技术（多轮自判断+反思+检索）将通过率提升至42.2%。人类参与研究发现特定指令能解决17/18个之前无法解决的问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为语言模型在竞争性编程领域提供了重要基准，展示了结合多种推理技术能显著提升模型表现，为开发具有扎实算法思维能力的语言模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

*Sanjeeevan Selvaganapathy,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现经过安全对齐的LLM在仇恨言论检测方面表现优于未对齐模型，但存在意识形态锚定效应，且所有模型在理解讽刺语言方面都存在严重缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在检测隐性和显性仇恨言论方面的有效性，比较经过安全对齐和未对齐模型的分类能力，探讨是否未对齐模型能提供更客观的分类

Method: 通过对比实验分析经过安全对齐和未对齐的LLM在仇恨言论检测任务中的表现，评估准确性、鲁棒性、意识形态一致性以及公平性

Result: 对齐模型显著优于未对齐模型（78.7% vs 64.1%准确率），但对齐模型具有强意识形态锚定效应，未对齐模型易受意识形态框架影响，所有模型在理解讽刺语言方面都存在严重失败

Conclusion: LLM不能作为客观仲裁者，需要更复杂的审计框架来考虑公平性、校准性和意识形态一致性

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Router Upcycling方法，通过从注意力头初始化多个路由器来改进MoE上循环中的路由性能，在复杂路由任务中实现SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型训练效率低，现有上循环技术中的简单路由器难以处理复杂路由任务，需要更有效的路由机制

Method: 从前面注意力层的注意力头初始化多个路由器，以类似注意力的方式协作分配token给专家，每个token生成多样化查询并与专家特征（作为键）对齐

Result: 实验结果表明该方法实现了最先进的性能，优于其他上循环基线方法

Conclusion: Router Upcycling技术有效提升了MoE上循环模型的路由能力，为高效训练MoE模型提供了新思路

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

### [32] [Do small language models generate realistic variable-quality fake news headlines?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00680)
*Austin McCutcheon,Chris Brogly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了14个小语言模型(SLMs)在生成虚假新闻标题方面的能力，发现这些模型对生成虚假内容配合度高，但生成的标题质量检测准确率较低(35.2%-63.5%)，表明生成的标题与真实人类撰写的内容相似度不高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估小语言模型(SLMs)生成虚假新闻标题的潜在风险，以及这些生成内容是否与真实新闻标题相似，从而了解SLMs在虚假信息传播中的潜在威胁。

Method: 使用14个SLMs模型(1.7B-14B参数)，通过受控提示工程生成24,000个低质量和高质量欺骗性新闻标题，然后应用现有的机器学习和深度学习新闻标题质量检测器进行分析。

Result: SLMs表现出高配合率，伦理约束有限；使用DistilBERT和bagging分类器的质量检测准确率仅为35.2%-63.5%，误分类现象普遍。

Conclusion: 测试的SLMs普遍能够配合生成虚假标题，但生成的标题与真实网络内容相似度较低，这既显示了SLMs的潜在风险，也表明当前检测技术存在局限性。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出文本强化模型(TeR)来增强多模态时间序列预测中的文本质量，通过强化学习优化文本生成以提升预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态时间序列预测方法依赖高质量文本输入，但实际中文本可能无法准确捕捉时间序列信息，导致性能不稳定，需要增强文本内容

Method: 设计文本强化模型(TeR)生成强化文本，采用基于多模态TSF模型性能和任务相关性的奖励机制的强化学习方法优化TeR

Result: 在覆盖多个领域的真实基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于强基线和现有研究

Conclusion: 通过强化文本模态可以有效提升多模态时间序列预测的性能，文本强化模型和强化学习方法的结合是有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

Motivation: 稀疏自编码器是揭示大型语言模型中可解释特征的有前途方法，但缺乏自动化评估方法阻碍了其广泛采用和发展。

Method: 基于精心策划的对比故事对数据集构建CE-Bench基准，通过全面的消融研究验证方法的有效性。

Result: CE-Bench能够可靠地测量稀疏自编码器的可解释性，并且与现有基准很好地保持一致。

Conclusion: CE-Bench为稀疏自编码器评估提供了有效的自动化解决方案，官方实现和评估数据集已开源。

Abstract: Probing with sparse autoencoders is a promising approach for uncovering
interpretable features in large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
automated evaluation methods has hindered their broader adoption and
development. In this work, we introduce CE-Bench, a novel and lightweight
contrastive evaluation benchmark for sparse autoencoders, built on a curated
dataset of contrastive story pairs. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that CE-Bench
reliably measures the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well
with existing benchmarks, all without requiring an external LLM. The official
implementation and evaluation dataset are open-sourced under the MIT License.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RevBrowse是一个基于LLM的评论驱动推荐框架，通过PrefRAG模块动态检索相关评论来解决传统方法在上下文窗口限制下的效率问题，在多个数据集上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在推荐系统中动态利用用户评论的挑战：1) 受限于上下文窗口的低效性问题 2) 缺乏针对当前决策上下文的相关评论优先级机制

Method: 提出RevBrowse框架，受"浏览-决策"过程启发，集成用户评论到LLM重排序过程；引入PrefRAG模块，将用户和物品表示解耦为结构化形式，并基于目标物品自适应检索偏好相关内容

Result: 在四个Amazon评论数据集上的广泛实验表明，RevBrowse相比强基线实现了持续且显著的改进，展现了其在建模动态用户偏好方面的泛化能力和有效性

Conclusion: RevBrowse不仅提升了推荐性能，还通过透明的检索增强过程提供了一定程度的可解释性，使影响最终推荐的评论可见

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

*Daehoon Gwak,Minseo Jung,Junwoo Park,Minho Park,ChaeHun Park,Junha Hyung,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS)解码策略，通过外部奖励模型在扩散过程中提供全局序列级信号，改善掩码扩散模型的非自回归生成顺序和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准置信度采样方法在掩码扩散模型中独立选择token，导致生成顺序类似于自回归过程，限制了非自回归建模的优势。

Method: RWS在每一步扩散过程中评估整个中间序列的质量，并相应缩放token对数概率，通过全局序列一致性指导token选择，促进更非自回归的生成顺序。

Result: 实验表明RWS显著促进了非自回归生成顺序，在多个评估指标上都有改进。

Conclusion: 集成全局信号能有效增强掩码扩散模型的非自回归特性和整体性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

Abstract: Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized,
scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study
introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to
support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a
design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five
phases: literature review, SWOT analysis, development of ethical-pedagogical
principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The
resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统比了编码器、解码器和FastText在中文AI生成文本检测中的性能，发现通过LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B表现最佳，达到95.94%测试准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，对AI生成文本的准确检测需求日益增长，特别是在中文语境下，细微语言细腻对当前方法构成重大挑战。

Method: 采用NLPCC 2025中文AI生成文本检测数据集，系统比较了编码器模型（中文BERT-large和RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large）、解码器LLM（Qwen2.5-7B通过LoRA微调）和FastText基线。编码器采用提示基于掩码语言建模方法，解码器采用指令格式输入和轻量分类头。

Result: 编码器模型虽然几乎记住了训练数据，但在分布偏移下性能显著降低（RoBERTa: 76.3%，BERT: 79.3%）。FastText显示了惊人的词汇稳健性（83.5%）但缺乏深层语义理解。LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B达到95.94%测试准确率，表现出更好的普适性和对数据集特定人工物的弹性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了基于解码器的大语言模型通过参数效率微调在中文AI生成文本检测中的效力。未来工作将探索Qwen3模型、精简版本和集成策略以进一步提升跨域稳健性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于问题分解的方法在检索中生成的提问往往不相关且不完整，导致事实丢失，且无法有效聚合来自不同文档和段落的证据片段。

Method: 使用上下文增强的两阶段忠实分解方法分解长答案为子事实，检索相关证据片段，在证据冲突时修订子事实，最后根据原句聚合证据。

Result: 在六个数据集上进行了广泛评估，并提出了新的证据精度评估指标$Attr_{auto-P}$。FIDES在GPT-3.5-turbo、Gemini和Llama 70B系列上平均优于SOTA方法超过14%。

Conclusion: FIDES框架有效解决了现有方法在问题分解和证据聚合方面的不足，显著提升了归因问答的性能。

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将司法意见生成分为法律推理和量刑预测两个独立子任务，导致推理与预测不一致，且依赖人工整理知识，实用性有限

Method: 提出LegalChainReasoner框架，应用结构化法律链指导模型进行综合案件评估，整合事实前提、复合法律条件和量刑结论，实现灵活知识注入和端到端意见生成

Result: 在两个真实世界开源中文法律案例数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于基线模型

Conclusion: 提出的司法意见生成任务和LegalChainReasoner框架能更好地符合法律实践需求，确保推理与判决的一致性

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Result: 模型在概念层面的准确度达到0.8，但精确匹配(EM)分数仍较低，特别是在测试阶段。两阶段推理管道对精确提取短答案有部分改善，但仍面临格式化输出的挑战

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了生物医学LLM应用中语义理解与精确答案评估之间的差距，需要进一步研究输出控制和后处理策略

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

Method: 提出Topic Model Translation (TMT)技术，无需元数据、嵌入或对齐语料库，即可将LDA等主题模型从源语言迁移到目标语言

Result: 通过定量和定性方法广泛评估，证明TMT能够产生语义一致且连贯的主题翻译结果

manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

TL;DR: 本文通过DSTC-12 Track 1挑战赛，开发了相对小规模模型（少于130亿参数）来预测对话级维度特定评分，比较了语言模型提示和编码器分类回归模型两种策略的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI对话系统的快速增长，如何有效评估这些系统成为一个关键挑战。本文旨在解决对话系统的自动评估问题，特别是在模型规模受限的情况下。

Method: 采用两种主要策略：1）通过提示使用语言模型作为评估器；2）训练基于编码器的分类和回归模型。所有模型都控制在相对较小的规模（少于130亿参数）。

Result: 语言模型提示方法仅与人类判断达到中等相关性，但在测试集上排名第二，仅被基线方法超越。编码器模型在验证集上对某些维度显示出高相关性，但在测试集上性能下降，主要因为测试集的评分范围与训练验证集存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 在模型规模受限的情况下，基于编码器的分类回归模型在验证集上表现良好，但测试集的数据分布差异影响了最终性能。语言模型提示方法虽然相关性不高，但在整体排名中表现相对较好。

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

Motivation: 负样本在对比学习中至关重要，现有方法在生成多样化负样本方面存在不足，需要更细粒度的语义区分能力

Method: 使用大语言模型生成多粒度困难负样本，采用从粗到细的课程学习策略；提出锚标记感知池化方法，基于LLM聚合模式为锚标记分配更高权重

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越现有合成策略，在合成数据和公共检索数据集上均表现优异

Conclusion: 多粒度困难负样本合成和锚标记感知池化方法能有效提升文本嵌入模型的语义表示能力，为对比学习提供了新的优化方向

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型作为强大的创作工具，存在放大有害社会偏见风险，需要系统评估其表征偏见并探索干预策略。

Method: 构建包含5个社会重要职业（CEO、护士、软件工程师、教师、运动员）的基准测试，使用中性提示与公平性控制提示对比5个先进模型（包括闭源和开源模型），对输出图像进行性别和种族标注并进行分布分析。

Result: 提示工程能显著改变人口统计表征，但效果高度模型依赖：有些模型能有效多样化，有些过度校正导致不现实的一致性，有些则响应性很低。

Conclusion: 提示工程作为公平性干预手段既有潜力也有局限性，需要结合模型层面的补充策略来解决偏见问题。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理欺骗性和误导性提示时会产生奉承幻觉，即模型优先考虑与输入隐含视角的一致性而非准确性，这影响了生成内容的真实性。

Method: 设计两种范式生成欺骗性/误导性输入来诱导一致的奉承幻觉，然后提出协作对比解码(CCD)方法，通过对比诱导输入和转换中性输入的输出分布偏差来减少对欺骗性信息的依赖。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提出的CCD方法能有效缓解奉承幻觉，并在各种任务中提高生成响应的真实性。

Conclusion: 协作对比解码是一种无需额外训练的有效方法，能够显著改善大语言模型在面对欺骗性提示时的表现，提高生成内容的真实性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

TL;DR: EviNote-RAG是一个代理式RAG框架，通过结构化检索-笔记-回答流程，训练模型生成支持性证据笔记(SENs)来提升开放域问答性能，解决了传统方法中噪声干扰和多跳推理错误累积的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-回答范式存在两个关键局限：(1)检索证据中信号噪声比低，有用信息被无关内容淹没；(2)多跳推理中不完整或噪声段落导致错误累积。

Method: 提出结构化检索-笔记-回答流程，训练模型生成简洁的支持性证据笔记(SENs)，保留答案相关信息并突出不确定性；引入基于蕴含的证据质量奖励(EQR)来评估SENs是否逻辑支持最终答案。

Result: 在领域内和领域外QA基准测试中，EviNote-RAG在准确性、泛化性和训练稳定性方面持续优于强基线，在HotpotQA、Bamboogle和2Wiki上分别获得20%、40%和91%的相对F1提升。

Conclusion: EviNote-RAG通过SENs和EQR的结合，实现了忠实且鲁棒的推理，同时减少了噪声影响，在保持最先进性能的同时增强了鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

Method: 构建了包含13,873个手动标注句子的罗马尼亚语数据集SeLeRoSa，涵盖多个领域。评估了多种LLM模型在零样本和微调设置下的性能，以及基于transformer的基线模型。

Result: 研究发现当前模型在句子级讽刺检测任务中存在局限性，LLM和transformer模型在该任务上的表现有待提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为讽刺检测研究开辟了新方向，揭示了现有模型的不足，为未来改进提供了基准和数据集基础。

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

TL;DR: 本文提出监督式上下文微调(SIFT)方法，将序列标注任务转化为约束响应生成问题，结合上下文学习和监督微调，显著优于传统方法。


<details>

Motivation: 由于因果语言模型的快速发展，预期其在序列标注任务上能超越停滞发展的编码器模型，但现有研究较少关注监督式生成式序列标注这一更自然的设置。

Method: 提出SIFT方法，将序列标注任务重新表述为约束响应生成问题，结合上下文学习(从演示中学习)和监督微调。

Result: SIFT在多个标准序列标注任务上显著优于上下文学习和解码器作为编码器的微调基线方法。研究发现长上下文会降低性能，但通过移除指令可以缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了LLMs在序列标注任务中的优势和局限性，强调了基于响应的生成式任务表述对于实现有效序列标注性能的重要性。

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

Conclusion: 结构化知识整合能有效增强LLM在医学翻译任务中的表现，MedCOD框架展示了这一方法的巨大潜力。

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

Result: 建立了连接两种范式的概念框架，形成了开发通用知识引擎的新方法

Conclusion: 结构与解构的协同作用为构建透明、可控、自适应的智能系统提供了新的技术路线

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised
classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of
labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial

several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and
supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used
to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents.

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

Motivation: 大语言模型在处理特定文化沟通规范方面存在困难，特别是在波斯taarof这种强调谦逊、间接和尊重的复杂礼仪系统方面，现有文化基准中完全缺失这方面的评估。

Method: 构建TaarofBench基准，包含450个角色扮演场景，覆盖12个常见社交话题；评估5个前沿LLM；通过监督微调和直接偏好优化方法提升模型表现；进行33人的人类研究（包括母语者、传承者和非伊朗人）建立基准。

Result: 主流LLM在文化适当时的表现准确率比母语者低40-48%；波斯语提示能改善性能；存在基于性别的不对称性；标准"礼貌"指标评价的回应经常违反taarof规范；通过优化方法显著提升了模型与文化期望的对齐度。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发多样化、文化感知的LLM奠定了基础，使应用能更好地处理复杂社交互动，揭示了西方礼貌框架在跨文化语境中的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的风格一致性评估指标和融合生成方法，用于危机沟通中保持自动回复的风格一致性，从而提高受影人群的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 危机沟通中自动化回复的风格一致性对于建立受影人群信任至关重要，但目前缺乏有效的方法来维持这种一致性。

Method: 采用两阶段融合生成方法：首先评估候选回复的风格，然后通过实例级融合过程进行优化和整合，以减少风格变异。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在回复质量和风格均匀性方面都持续超过基准方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为危机沟通中的风格一致性问题提供了有效解决方案，通过新的评估指标和融合生成技术，能够在保持高质量回复的同时减少风格变异。

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

TL;DR: 提出Controlled-Literacy框架，结合检索增强生成和强化学习，为不同健康素养水平的受众生成定制化的反健康错误信息言论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的反错误信息言论往往千篇一律，忽视了受众健康素养水平对言论可及性和有效性的影响，需要针对不同健康素养水平进行个性化定制。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)技术检索与特定健康素养水平对齐的知识，设计包含主观用户偏好和客观可读性奖励的奖励函数，通过强化学习优化生成针对目标健康素养水平的反错误信息言论。

Result: 实验结果表明，Controlled-Literacy框架优于基线方法，能够生成更易获取和用户更偏好的反错误信息言论。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提高反健康错误信息言论的可及性和理解度，为更公平和有效的公共卫生沟通做出了贡献。

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

TL;DR: 评估7个大语言模型在伊斯兰继承法领域的知识和推理能力，发现o3和Gemini 2.5表现优异（准确率>90%），而其他模型表现较差（<50%），揭示了在结构化法律推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在伊斯兰继承法（'ilm al-mawarith）这一专业领域的知识和推理能力，了解模型在处理复杂法律规则和计算继承份额方面的表现。

Method: 使用包含1,000个多选题的基准测试，涵盖多样化的继承场景，测试模型理解继承背景和计算伊斯兰法规定份额的能力。对7个LLM进行评估并进行详细的错误分析。

Result: o3和Gemini 2.5模型准确率超过90%，表现优异；而ALLaM、Fanar、LLaMA和Mistral模型准确率低于50%，表现较差。错误模式包括对继承场景的误解、法律规则应用错误和领域知识不足。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在伊斯兰法律推理方面存在显著差异，反映了推理能力和领域适应性的重要区别。研究结果突显了处理结构化法律推理的局限性，并为改进伊斯兰法律推理性能提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

*Farah Adeeba,Rajesh Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 乌尔都语中-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代语法中极不合法，尽管19世纪文献中常见，这种历时变化源于主格格位分配与及物动词完成体要求作格之间的形态句法冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乌尔都语动词与体组合中的范式空缺：-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代乌尔都语和印地语中极不合法，但在19世纪文献中却自由出现，需要探究这种历时变化的成因。

Method: 通过历史文本分析、大规模语料库研究（确认完成体形式的显著缺失）以及母语者的主观评价任务（判断完成体例句的天然性）。

Result: 研究发现完成体形式在现代语法中高度不自然，这种空缺源于形态句法冲突：该结构要求主格主语和不变分词，但与及物动词完成体分配作格的核心语法规则相冲突。

Conclusion: 这种冲突导致完成体形式不稳定，其功能被其他结构替代，使得该空缺在现代语法中得以巩固。

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DistilledPRAG是一种知识蒸馏的参数化RAG模型，通过将文档编码为LoRA参数而非明文，在保护隐私的同时实现高效推理，并在准确性和泛化性上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有参数化RAG(PRAG)的两个关键问题：1)需要为每个文档单独微调LLM导致推理延迟过高；2)仅依赖合成QA数据导致在分布外数据上泛化性能差。

Method: 1)合成单文档和多文档QA对增强跨文档推理；2)用特殊标记掩码明文文档并通过参数生成器转换为LoRA；3)通过知识蒸馏训练参数生成器匹配标准RAG的隐藏状态和输出logits。

Result: 在四个QA数据集上的实验表明，DistilledPRAG在准确性上优于基线方法，并在分布外数据上表现出良好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG成功实现了高效参数化的同时保持RAG级别的性能，为隐私保护推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

TL;DR: REFRAG是一个针对RAG应用的高效解码框架，通过压缩、感知和扩展机制，利用检索上下文的稀疏性结构，在保持性能的同时显著降低延迟并扩展上下文长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs在处理长上下文RAG应用时存在显著延迟和内存消耗问题，而检索到的段落中只有小部分与查询直接相关，大部分计算是不必要的。

Method: 提出REFRAG框架，通过分析RAG中块对角注意力模式的稀疏性结构，设计压缩、感知和扩展机制来优化解码过程，减少不必要的计算。

Result: 实现了30.85倍的首次令牌时间加速（相比先前工作提升3.75倍），无困惑度损失，并能将LLMs的上下文大小扩展16倍。

Conclusion: REFRAG在多种长上下文任务中均能提供显著加速且不损失准确性，证明了利用RAG上下文稀疏性进行优化的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究自然演变的上下文段落如何影响生成式大语言模型在问答任务中的表现，分析文本自然演变对LLM理解能力的挑战

Method: 提出一个框架来整理当代QA基准中自然演变、人工编辑的阅读段落变体，并在不同语义相似度分数范围内分析LLM性能，评估了6个QA数据集和8个具有公开训练数据的LLM

Result: 实验显示LLM性能随着阅读段落与预训练版本自然偏离而下降，即使问题和所有必要信息在推理时都存在。例如BoolQ数据集上平均模型准确率从最高到最低相似度区间下降超过30%，多个LLM的斜率超过70

Conclusion: 自然文本演变对LLM的语言理解能力构成了重大挑战，表明当前模型在处理与预训练数据有自然差异的文本时存在显著性能退化

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型只能从左到右解码，限制了代码生成的灵活性。为了支持更灵活的生成策略（如草图优先、交错推理等），需要开发能够自适应确定解码策略的模型。

Method: 将预训练的自回归检查点适配到离散扩散框架，使用连续时间加权交叉熵目标。训练包括：1）监督微调，通过随机截断和填充惩罚提高样本效率；2）使用可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上达到21.4% pass@1，在HumanEval、MBPP、BigCodeBench和CRUXEval等基准测试中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: Dream-Coder 7B展示了离散扩散模型在代码生成任务中的潜力，提供了灵活的生成策略，并开源了模型、训练配方和推理代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We
release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training
recipes, preprocessing pipelines, and inference code to facilitate

Method: 使用大语言模型进行实体对齐的双重翻译策略，并利用多语言维基百科数据微调大语言模型以增强实体对齐效果

Result: 该方法旨在改善非拉丁语系语言的跨语言命名实体识别性能

Conclusion: EAT方法通过实体对齐翻译策略有效解决了非拉丁语系语言在跨语言命名实体识别中的挑战

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效利用任务和时序知识，展示了在多任务跨时代中文信息抽取中的有效性。

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse
temporal domains, including Classical and Modern documents. Fine-tuning a
single model on heterogeneous tasks and across different eras may lead to
interference and reduced performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
Tea-MOELoRA, a parameter-efficient multi-task framework that combines LoRA with
a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in
different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism
dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA
outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Method: 提出SAT框架：1)通过多任务对比学习进行分层知识对齐，将图嵌入与自然语言空间对齐；2)使用统一图指令结合轻量级知识适配器进行结构指令调优，指导LLM执行结构感知推理

Result: 在4个基准数据集的两个KGC任务上，SAT显著优于最先进方法，特别是在链接预测任务中提升8.7%到29.8%

Conclusion: SAT框架通过结构感知对齐调优有效解决了KGC中的表示空间不一致问题，实现了统一的多任务处理，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Conclusion: 通过合成数据生成框架，有效解决了长上下文数据缺乏的问题，为进一步提升大语言模型的长文本处理能力提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long
textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications.
However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context
capabilities in LLMs.

Motivation: AI系统依赖自然语言原则时存在解释性模糊问题，这会导致模型行为不一致和不稳定，而当前AI对齐流程缺乏类似法律系统的制度性保障机制

Method: 提出包含两个法律机制的计算框架：(1)规则精炼流程，通过修订模糊规则来最小化解释分歧；(2)基于提示的解释约束，通过类似法律准则的机制减少规则应用的不一致性

Result: 在WildChat数据集的5000个场景子集上评估，显示两种干预措施都能显著提高合理解释者之间的判断一致性

Conclusion: 该框架为系统管理解释性模糊提供了第一步，是构建更稳健、遵循规则的AI系统的关键步骤

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

### [71] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning through Model Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01213)
*Ege Süalp,Mina Rezaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于模型增长的预训练策略（特别是Transformer堆叠）在缓解大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题方面的效果。研究发现增长型模型在阅读理解和推理任务上表现出更好的知识保留能力，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的主要挑战，特别是在大语言模型持续微调时，模型容易丢失先前学到的知识。虽然基于模型增长的预训练策略（如Transformer堆叠）已被证明能加速收敛，但其对遗忘问题的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用模型增长策略，通过堆叠较小的Transformer模型来构建更大的模型（Stack LLM），并与传统训练方法（LLM）进行对比。在一系列微调任务（包括领域知识、推理、阅读理解和偏见评估）上评估两种模型的性能保持能力。

Result: 两种模型在领域知识上都有提升，但推理和阅读理解能力随时间退化，显示灾难性遗忘迹象。Stack LLM在所有任务中表现出更少的性能退化，特别是在阅读理解方面。在偏见评估中，基线LLM逐渐变得更加中立，而Stack LLM保持约60-61%的稳定偏见比例。

Conclusion: 基于增长的预训练策略在抵抗灾难性遗忘方面提供了适度的改进，特别是在知识保留方面表现更好，但在处理社会偏见方面需要权衡考虑。这种方法为缓解持续学习中的遗忘问题提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

TL;DR: 提出了DaMoC框架，通过数据压缩和模型压缩技术，快速选择最优大语言模型进行微调，节省约20倍训练时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现优异，但在特定领域任务中需要微调。面对众多开源模型，如何快速选择最适合微调的模型是一个挑战

Method: 1) 数据层面：建立数据过滤方法分类（分布感知、质量感知、混合方法），进行token压缩和文本重写优化；2) 模型层面：使用层相似性评分评估层重要性，移除低重要性层，采用稀疏合并范式保留原始模型能力

Result: 在医疗问答、金融问答、通用问答和阅读理解四个数据集上的实验表明，能够选择最优LLM同时节省约20倍训练时间

Conclusion: DaMoC框架有效解决了LLM选择难题，通过数据模型压缩技术显著提升效率，为领域特定任务的高效微调提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从上下文学习与预训练先验的双重关系角度，探索了Chain-of-Thought推理的工作机制，通过细粒度词汇分析和噪声样本实验揭示了模型如何在预训练先验和上下文信息之间平衡，并发现长推理链提示能提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Chain-of-Thought推理方法日益受到关注，但其底层工作机制仍不明确。研究者希望从上下文学习与预训练先验的双重关系角度，深入理解这种推理方法的工作机制。

Method: 1) 对推理过程进行细粒度词汇级分析；2) 通过逐步引入噪声样本来检验模型如何平衡预训练先验和错误上下文信息；3) 研究提示工程是否能诱导大语言模型进行慢思考。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：1) 模型不仅能快速学习词汇级推理结构，还能掌握更深层的逻辑推理模式，但严重依赖预训练先验；2) 提供足够样本会使模型决策从预训练先验转向上下文信号，但误导性提示会引入不稳定性；3) 长推理链提示能诱导模型生成更长推理链，从而提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought推理的成功源于模型在预训练先验和上下文学习之间的有效平衡，通过适当的提示工程可以诱导更深入的推理过程，从而提升模型性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

Motivation: 情感是人类社会功能中的关键现象，但在文本表现方面仍是一个开放的研究领域。传统方法存在局限，需要从评估角度提供不同视角来补充现有研究。

Method: 使用工业语料库进行人工标注，采用评估性情感分析方法。训练语言模型来分析标注数据，探究标注分歧背后的统计规律和语言特征。

Result: 标注数据虽然存在显著分歧，但遵循稳定的统计趋势。语言模型能够成功建模标注过程，变异性由底层语言特征驱动。模型能够基于评估标准区分情感情境。

Conclusion: 评估性情感分析方法提供了有价值的补充视角，语言模型在理解和建模情感标注过程方面表现出强大能力，为情感分析研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

TL;DR: 本文主张从静态的"琐事中心"文化评估范式转向"有意文化评估"，强调需要系统性地审视评估中嵌入的文化假设，而不仅仅是在明确的文化任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM文化对齐评估主要采用基于静态事实的多选题或简答题，将文化简化为孤立的知识点，忽视了文化的多元性和互动性本质，以及文化假设在"中性"评估环境中的渗透。

Method: 提出"有意文化评估"框架，系统分析评估中文化相关考虑因素的出现时机、方式和环境，强调研究者立场性的重要性，并建议采用HCI启发的参与式方法让社区参与评估设计。

Result: 建立了系统化的文化评估理论框架，指出了当前基准测试实践的局限性，并为发现未知的重要应用领域提供了方向。

Conclusion: 需要超越现有的文化评估范式，通过系统性的文化意识评估方法和社区参与，推动更具包容性和文化对齐的NLP研究发展。

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在表格问答任务中面临的结构异质性、目标数据定位困难和复杂推理瓶颈等工业应用挑战。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）用结构化表模式替代完全文本化表格；2）查询感知的表格缩放机制动态生成子表模式；3）程序化思维策略将查询转换为可执行代码。结合ReAct范式实现迭代推理。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B-Instruct模型上，TableZoomer在DataBench数据集上比传统PoT方法准确率提升19.34%，在TableBench数据集的事实检查任务上提升25%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持可用性优势的同时，显著提升了不同规模表格的性能和可扩展性，为工业级表格问答应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何利用参数高效微调技术(PEFTs)在低资源领域实现有效的领域适应，通过在多个高资源数据集上训练适配器来提升在未见低资源领域的文本摘要性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然通用，但在新领域的适应能力有限，特别是在低资源且无标注数据的领域。传统微调方法计算成本高且耗时，需要更高效的领域适应方案。

Method: 使用6种参数高效微调技术(PEFTs)在Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型上，基于14个来自科学、医疗、法律和新闻领域的高资源数据集进行训练，评估领域内和跨领域适配器的效果。

Result: 实验表明，对于低资源领域，使用领域内适配器的推理性能优于少样本学习，甚至超过了更大的Llama-3-70B-Instruct模型。跨领域适配器和策略性组合适配器也能利用语言相似性提升性能。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调技术能够有效解决低资源领域的适应问题，领域内适配器表现最佳，跨领域适配器在缺乏领域内数据时提供了可行的替代方案，为低资源场景下的领域适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律评测标准无法有效评估大语言模型在开放式法条基础问答中的表现，需要专门的评测框架来测试多跳法律推理能力。

Method: 构建韩国法律可解释问答评测标准KoBLEX（226个场景化问答），提出Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval (ParSeR)方法通过生成参数化法条引导检索，并设计Legal Fidelity Evaluation (LF-Eval)自动评估指标。

Result: ParSeR在多个LLM上均表现最佳，相比标准检索方法在GPT-4o上实现F1指标+37.91，LF-Eval+30.81的提升，在不同推理深度下都保持一致性能。

Conclusion: KoBLEX标准和ParSeR方法有效解决了法律领域多跳推理评测的挑战，为LLM在专业法律领域的可靠性提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Method: 系统评估LLMs在8种不同纸牌游戏中的学习能力，通过高质量游戏数据进行监督微调，分析模型在掌握游戏的同时保持通用能力的情况，并研究整合通用指令数据的效果。

Result: LLMs通过高质量数据微调可接近强游戏AI性能；能同时掌握多个复杂纸牌游戏，规则相似的游戏性能有协同提升，不相似的则存在冲突；掌握复杂游戏时通用能力会下降，但整合通用指令数据可缓解此问题。

Conclusion: 评估结果表明LLMs具有强大的学习能力和多任务适应性，在复杂游戏领域展现出巨大潜力，但需要在专业化和通用性之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型通常需要苛费的优化过程（如强化学习）来掌握复杂的理由任务，本研究试图提取并转移这种理由能力

Method: 从两个公开的Qwen2.5模型中提取理由向量：v_reason = θ_GRPO - θ_SFT，并通过简单的向量加法将其添加到兼容的指令微调模型中

Result: 在多个理由测试集上稳定提升性能：GSM8K (+4.9%)、HumanEval (+4.3%)、SciQ (+1.7%)、BigBenchHard (+12.3%)，逆向减去向量导致性能显著下降

Conclusion: 理由能力可以从现有开源模型中提取并通过简单的张量运算重用，为模型增强提供了一种实用方法

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线危害日益严重，特别是仇恨言论问题。需要结合自动化系统的速度和人类审核员的判断力，开发既能检测有害内容又能清晰解释决策的工具。

Method: 构建AI代理系统，使用大语言模型配合专业工具：对比真实仇恨言论示例、BERT分类器标记有害信息、查询俚语词典、生成思维链推理、检查平台指南。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法超越现有最先进方法，达到0.91的宏F1分数。

Conclusion: WATCHED工具通过AI与人类监督的协作，有效减少在线危害，为审核员、安全团队和研究人员提供支持。

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种域无关的框架，通过半合成数据集自动评估和人工评测组合，来高效创建跨文档链接数据集并选择最佳链接方法。在同行审查和新闻领域的实验显示，综合检索模型和大语言模型的方法将精准度提升了一倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文档关系理解对许应用领域至关重要，但缺乏高效的训练和评估数据集创建方法限制了自动化研究的发展。

Method: 提出域无关框架：先生成和验证半合成跨文档数据集进行自动评估，生成性能最佳的链接方法短列表，然后进行深度人工评估获得自然文本对的性能估计。

Result: 在同行审查和新闻两个领域的实验显示，综合检索模型和大语言模型的方法获得了人类评定者的78%链接批准率，比单独使用强大检索器的精准度提升了一倍以上。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨应用场景的跨文档理解研究提供了系统性方法，所创建的新颖数据集为跨文档任务（如媒体框架和同行审查）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经音频编码器产生的语言标记的统计特性以及这些特性如何影响语音识别和重构性能

Method: 使用Zipf定律、Heaps定律、熵以及冗余度来分析NAC标记，并通过自动语音识别错误率和UTMOS评分来评估语义保持和语音质量

Result: 发现NAC标记特别是3-grams呈现出类似于自然语言的统计模式，这些特性与信息内容量一起与语音识别和重构任务的性能提升呈正相关

Conclusion: 研究结果为神经音频编码器标记序列的结构提供了见解，并为设计更有效的生成式语音模型提供了指导

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学应用题上表现出色，但在识别学生解题过程中的错误步骤等元推理任务上仍有困难，需要改进错误定位能力。

Method: 使用VtG和PRM800K两个错误推理数据集，提出生成中间修正的学生解决方案的方法，使其更接近原始学生解法，从而帮助改进错误定位性能。

Result: 实验表明，即使提供参考答案，最先进的LLMs也难以准确定位学生解题中的第一个错误步骤。提出的中间修正方法有助于提升错误定位性能。

Conclusion: 通过生成与原始学生解法更接近的中间修正方案，可以有效提升LLMs在学生解题错误定位任务上的表现，为解决元推理挑战提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过思维链提示展现强大推理能力，但推理过程不透明，难以在高风险场景中进行验证、调试和控制。

Method: 提出Vis-CoT人机交互框架，将线性思维链文本转换为交互式推理图，用户可可视化逻辑流程、识别错误步骤，通过剪枝错误路径和嫁接新前提进行干预。

Result: 在GSM8K和StrategyQA数据集上，Vis-CoT比非交互式基线提高最终答案准确率高达24个百分点，用户研究显示可用性和信任度大幅提升。

Conclusion: Vis-CoT通过结合LLM与针对性人工监督，为更可靠、可理解和协作的推理提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究创建了一个基于世界价值观调查的评估框架，系统评估大型语言模型在全球不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况。研究发现LLMs仅与少数国家适当或过度对齐，而与大多数国家对齐不足，且通过匹配问卷语言可以更有效地引导模型与对应国家意见对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注美国或少数国家的人口群体意见，缺乏全球国家样本、不同历史时期人类意见研究，以及使用语言引导LLMs的讨论，同时忽视了提示语言对LLMs意见对齐的潜在影响。

Method: 基于世界价值观调查(WVS)创建评估框架，系统评估LLMs在不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐程度，并测试通过改变提示语言来引导模型对齐的效果。

Result: LLMs仅与少数国家适当或过度对齐，而与大多数国家对齐不足；改变提示语言匹配问卷语言能比现有引导方法更有效地使LLMs与对应国家意见对齐；LLMs更符合当代人群意见。

Conclusion: 这是首个在全球、语言和时间维度上全面调查LLMs意见对齐主题的研究，填补了现有研究的空白，提供了系统性的评估框架和有效的语言引导方法。

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/nlply/global-opinion-alignment.

TL;DR: UniCR是一个统一框架，将多种不确定性证据转换为校准的正确概率，通过原则性拒绝来执行用户指定的错误预算，提高语言模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署的语言模型需要决定何时不回答，现有方法在不确定性校准和风险控制方面存在不足，需要统一的框架来处理异构不确定性证据。

Method: 使用温度缩放和适当评分学习轻量级校准头，支持黑盒API模型，采用符合风险控制的分布无关保证，对长文本生成通过检索证据监督原子事实性得分。

Result: 在短问答、代码生成和检索增强长问答实验中，校准指标持续改进，风险-覆盖曲线下面积降低，固定风险下覆盖范围更高。

Conclusion: UniCR提供了一个从证据融合到校准概率再到风险控制决策的可移植方案，无需微调基础模型，在分布偏移下仍有效，提高了模型的可信度。

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练后知识静态化，完整重训练成本高昂。现有知识编辑技术要么过度依赖表面线索，要么在噪声多跳条件下表现不佳

Method: 提出Reason-KE框架，引导预训练LLM通过四个结构化阶段：事实确认、相关性判定、选择性应用和最终推理，在单次处理中过滤干扰信息

Result: 在MQuAKE-CF数据集上，Reason-KE将Qwen2.5-7B的多跳问答准确率提升至90.2%，在重度干扰下仅下降6.3%，答案泄露时下降<1%

Conclusion: Reason-KE展现了强大的鲁棒性和效率，为可靠的LLM知识更新建立了新的最先进水平

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型会产生事实错误的幻觉，研究者主要使用检索增强语言模型(RALMs)和拒绝后训练两种方法，但当前研究忽视了RALMs拒绝能力的评估，需要探究RALMs是否知道何时不知道。

Method: 通过分析不同内部和外部知识状态下RALMs的校准情况，研究拒绝感知指令调优和上下文微调方法对过度拒绝问题的影响，并开发了一种简单的拒绝方法来改善答案质量。

Result: 发现LLMs表现出显著的过度拒绝行为；上下文微调缓解了过度拒绝问题，而R-tuning则放大了该问题；拒绝能力可能与答案质量存在冲突。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对RALM系统中重要因素影响的更全面理解，开发的有效拒绝方法能够改善拒绝后训练模型的整体答案质量，为缓解幻觉问题提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用简单的top-k语义搜索，常常导致包含不相关或冗余信息，降低性能效率

Method: 提出五阶段模块化设计：初始检索、相关性验证、备用检索、上下文优先级排序和token预算分配，实现细粒度控制

Result: 在Wikipedia数据集上减少57%上下文，在复杂HotpotQA数据集上减少75%，显著提升上下文效率

Conclusion: MeVe为更可扩展和可靠的LLM应用提供了框架，通过精炼上下文信息实现更好的基础事实支持

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

Motivation: 比较不同历史时期和组织背景下社区工会主义(CU)的实践差异，验证现代NLP技术在历史劳工档案研究中的应用价值。

Method: 使用BERTopic进行主题建模和cTF-IDF权重计算，结合词频分析，对比分析1920年代国家皮鞋工会和2010-2020年代Unite Community的话语特征。

Result: 现代Unite Community更突出外向型社会正义主题，而历史B&S工会更重视内部管理和成员服务，两者在社区工会主义实践方式上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 两个工会虽都涉及社区相关主题，但其参与模式存在根本性分异，这挖战了社区工会主义在不同时期和行业间存在连续性和普遍性的假设。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在大规模数据上训练时往往捕捉伪相关而非真实因果关系，导致在分布外(OOD)场景下性能不佳，需要有效利用因果知识进行预测和生成。

Method: 提出CAT方法：1) 自动化流水线利用人类先验生成token级因果信号；2) 引入Re-Attention机制指导训练，使模型关注因果结构并减轻注意力分数中的噪声和偏差。

Result: 在提出的Spurious Token Game (STG)基准和多个下游任务上的实验表明，该方法能有效利用因果知识进行预测，并在OOD场景中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAT方法成功将因果知识注入LLMs的注意力机制，显著提升了模型在因果推理和OOD泛化方面的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

Motivation: 随着任务复杂度增加，基于LLM的工具代理难以正确识别和调用API，需要更好的方法来理解API依赖关系

Method: 将API文档转换为结构化API图，构建专家标注的In-N-Out数据集，利用API图进行多工具查询和组合API调用

Result: 使用In-N-Out数据集使工具检索和多工具查询生成性能几乎翻倍，微调模型可缩小90%的性能差距

Conclusion: 显式API图对工具代理具有重要价值，In-N-Out数据集是理解API文档和参数关系的宝贵资源

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

Method: 提出EAGLE方法，从LLM的多个中间层提取内部信念，聚合这些层间信念并计算置信度分数分布的期望值，生成更准确的置信度分数

Result: 在多样化数据集和LLM上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE显著优于现有基线方法，改善了校准性能

Conclusion: EAGLE通过利用LLM内部隐藏状态进行自评估校准，能够更准确地反映模型内部确定性，为解决LLM过度自信问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

Motivation: 研究动机是探究句子嵌入空间中距离的接近性是否意味着句子在语言任务上具有相似的性能表现，以及不同句子嵌入方法是否以相同方式编码相同信息。

Method: 使用三种方法计算句子嵌入：平均词嵌入、特殊[CLS]标记嵌入和随机词嵌入，分析这些嵌入变体之间的距离与其在语言任务上性能的相关性。

Result: 结果显示余弦相似度只能捕捉句子嵌入之间的浅层共性或差异，这些差异不能预测在特定任务上的性能表现。语言信息是通过不同维度的加权组合编码的。

Conclusion: 句子嵌入空间的几何结构不能预测其相对性能，语言信息的编码方式比简单的几何距离关系更为复杂，涉及不同维度的加权组合。

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

TL;DR: 本文构建了中国现代诗歌AI生成文本检测的新基准，通过实验验证现有检测器在诗歌识别上效果差强，特别是对风格等本质特征的检测难度最大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，AI生成的中国现代诗歌已经难以与人类作品区分，严重干扰了诗歌生态系统，必须开发专门的检测方法。

Method: 构建了高质量数据集，包含6位专业诗人的800首诗歌和4个主流LLMs生成的41,600首诗歌，系统性地评估了6种检测器的性能。

Result: 实验结果显示现有检测器无法作为可靠的工具来检测LLMs生成的现代诗歌，其中风格等本质特征的检测难度最大。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了新基准的有效性和必要性，为未来AI生成诗歌的检测奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

TL;DR: TransGAT模型结合微调Transformer和图注意力网络，通过双流预测实现作文分析性评分，在ELLIPSE数据集上达到0.854的平均QWK分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工评分耗时且不一致，现有自动作文评分方法使用静态词嵌入无法捕捉上下文语义，且多采用整体评分忽略了语法、词汇等具体写作维度

Method: 提出TransGAT方法，将微调的Transformer模型（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTaV3）与GAT配对，第一流生成篇章级预测，第二流在Transformer词嵌入上应用GAT（基于句法依赖构建边），最后融合两流预测

Result: 在ELLIPSE数据集上，TransGAT超越基线模型，在所有分析性评分维度上平均QWK达到0.854

Conclusion: TransGAT展示了结合Transformer上下文理解能力和GAT关系建模优势的潜力，能够推动自动作文评分系统的发展

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

Result: 实玹了高性能的语音相似度计算方法，通过聚类算法成功识别出语音相似的单词群

Conclusion: 该方法在语音结构分析中具有可行性和有效性，并可易扩展到其他语言

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

TL;DR: 提出InSide模型，通过图神经网络联合建模新闻语义和意图信号，用于假新闻检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测方法主要依赖语义线索（如情感词、文体特征），容易陷入表面模式检测，在动态环境中性能有限。需要从意图角度深入理解新闻欺骗的内在思想

Method: Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide)：将语义和意图信号重构为异构图结构，通过实体引导实现长距离上下文交互，采用粗到细的意图建模，并使用基于动态路径的图对齐策略

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验证明了InSide相比最先进方法的优越性

Conclusion: 通过联合建模语义和意图信号，能够更深入地理解新闻欺骗的本质，显著提升假新闻检测性能

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Abdelkrime Aries*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了chDzDT，一个面向阿尔及利亚方言的字符级预训练语言模型，专门处理该方言复杂的形态学特征和多语言混合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔及利亚方言在自然语言处理中代表性不足，其复杂的形态学、频繁的语码转换、多文字系统和多语言词汇影响使得传统词级或子词级方法效果有限。

Method: 开发字符级预训练模型chDzDT，在孤立单词上进行训练，不依赖分词边界。训练语料来自YouTube评论、多语言维基百科和Tatoeba项目，覆盖多种文字和语言变体。

Result: 构建了阿尔及利亚多语言词典数据集，并通过详细形态学分析验证了字符级建模对形态丰富、资源稀缺方言的有效性。

Conclusion: 字符级建模为形态丰富的低资源方言处理提供了有效解决方案，为构建更具包容性和适应性的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

*Andong Hua,Kenan Tang,Chenhe Gu,Jindong Gu,Eric Wong,Yao Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLM的提示词敏感性主要是评估方法造成的假象，而非模型固有缺陷。使用LLM作为评判者时，模型表现差异显著减小，提示词鲁棒性更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视广泛报道的LLM提示词敏感性现象，探究这是否是模型的固有弱点还是评估过程的人为假象。

Method: 系统评估7个LLM模型（包括GPT和Gemini系列）在6个基准测试上的表现，使用12种不同的提示模板，对比启发式评估方法和LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法。

Result: 发现提示词敏感性主要源于启发式评估方法（如对数似然评分和严格答案匹配），这些方法经常忽略语义正确但表达方式不同的回答。使用LLM-as-a-Judge评估时，性能方差显著降低，模型排名相关性更高。

Conclusion: 现代LLM对提示模板的鲁棒性比之前认为的要强，提示词敏感性更多是评估方法的问题而非模型缺陷。

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的大语言模型发展，AI面试官系统能够实时进行语音调查。本文旨在评估这类系统在定量和定性研究中的数据收集适用性，为研究实践提供指导。

Method: 通过回顾新兴证据，从两个维度评估AI面试官和传统IVR系统：输入/输出性能（语音识别、答案记录、情感处理）和语言推理能力（追问、澄清、分支逻辑处理）。

Result: 实地研究表明，AI面试官在定量和定性数据收集中已超越IVR系统能力，但存在实时转录错误率较高、情感检测能力有限、后续提问质量不均等问题。

Conclusion: 当前AI面试官技术的实用性、使用和采用可能取决于具体的研究背景，特别是在定性数据收集工作中，技术成熟度仍有待提升。

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)数据复杂且非结构化，传统机器学习方法无法高效提取关键患者信息，影响临床医生的使用效果。

Method: 将序列标注任务重构为文本生成问题，利用LLMs生成模拟医生思维过程的推理步骤，并集成BERT Score等语义相似性指标改进评估方法。

Result: 提出的方法显著提高了从EHRs中提取信息的准确性和可用性，为医疗人员提供了更好的决策支持。

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗健康领域的AI应用提供了可扩展的解决方案，通过改进信息提取过程最终提升了患者照护质量。

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督方法，用于自动提取和链接主诉中的实体，无需人工标注，在120万条真实世界主诉记录上取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主诉记录存在多种录入方式，导致医疗标注差异很大，难以在不同医疗机构间标准化，给记录保存和文本挖掘带来困难

Method: 采用分割匹配算法生成弱标注（实体提及跨度和类别标签），然后训练基于BERT的模型来定位实体提及并将其链接到预定义本体

Result: 在无需人工标注的情况下，弱监督实体提取和链接方法相比先前方法产生了优越的性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决主诉记录标准化问题，为医疗文本挖掘提供了可行的弱监督解决方案

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

Motivation: 解决各领域（如税务、保险、银行、医疗等）中常见的争议问题，通过AI辅助人类法官提高争议解决效率和质量。

Method: 开发DRAssist系统，首先识别争议的关键结构元素（事实、争议点、论据等）并生成结构化摘要，然后使用多种提示策略让LLM在三个层面输出争议解决方案：识别整体优势方、判断具体需求是否可接受、评估论据强弱。

Result: 通过合适的评估指标与相关基线进行比较，评估了LLM在所有任务上的性能表现。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可以作为有效的争议解决助手，在结构化分析和多层级决策方面展现出潜力，特别是在汽车保险和域名争议领域。

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: StructCoh是一个图增强对比学习框架，通过结合结构推理和表示空间优化来提升文本语义匹配性能，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然擅长捕捉token级交互，但往往忽略层次结构模式，且在细微语义区分方面存在困难。需要同时理解结构关系和细粒度语义区别。

Method: 1) 双图编码器通过依存解析和主题建模构建语义图，使用图同构网络传播结构特征；2) 分层对比目标在多个粒度上强制一致性：节点级对比正则化保留核心语义单元，图感知对比学习通过显式和隐式负采样策略对齐文档间结构语义。

Result: 在三个法律文档匹配基准和学术抄袭检测数据集上表现显著优于最先进方法。特别是在法律条文匹配上达到86.7% F1分数（绝对提升6.2%），有效识别论证结构相似性。

Conclusion: StructCoh通过图增强对比学习成功结合了结构推理和表示优化，在文本语义匹配任务中取得了显著性能提升，证明了结构信息对于语义理解的重要性。

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域具有变革潜力，但其解释纵向患者叙述的能力尚未充分探索。牙科拥有丰富的结构化临床数据，为评估LLM的推理能力提供了独特机会。

Method: 使用34个标准化纵向牙周病例（包含258个问答对），通过开放式临床任务评估GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash、Copilot和DeepSeek V3四种模型的表现，采用自动化指标和执业牙医盲法评估。

Result: DeepSeek表现最佳，显示出更高的忠实度（中位数得分0.528 vs 0.367-0.457）和专家评分（中位数4.5/5 vs 4.0/5），且未显著影响可读性。

Conclusion: DeepSeek被定位为案例分析的领先LLM，支持其作为辅助工具集成到医学教育和研究中，并突显其作为领域特定代理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

### [110] [Attributes as Textual Genes: Leveraging LLMs as Genetic Algorithm Simulators for Conditional Synthetic Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02040)
*Guangzeng Han,Weisi Liu,Xiaolei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Genetic Prompt是一个结合遗传算法和LLM的框架，通过将语义文本属性作为基因序列，利用LLM模拟交叉和变异操作来增强合成数据生成的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型擅长生成合成数据，但确保其质量和多样性仍然具有挑战性。需要一种方法来产生更接近真实世界数据分布的合成数据。

Method: 将语义文本属性视为基因序列，利用LLM模拟遗传算法中的交叉和变异操作，并集成主动学习方案来优化父代选择，扩展后代搜索空间。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的实验表明，Genetic Prompt显著优于最先进的基线方法，在不同规模的生成器模型上都表现出稳健性能。将合成数据与原始训练集融合能显著提升下游模型性能，特别是在类别不平衡场景中。

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt是一种有效的生产高质量合成数据的方法，适用于广泛的NLP应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

TL;DR: 指令微调显著改善大语言模型的长度控制能力，主要通过深层网络组件的专业化实现，在不同语言中采用不同的补偿机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型与指令微调模型在英语和意大利语长度控制文本生成方面的差异，探索指令微调对模型内部组件功能的影响

Method: 使用累积加权归因（源自直接对数归因）分析模型性能和内部组件贡献，比较基础模型和指令微调模型在不同语言中的表现

Result: 指令微调大幅提升长度控制能力，英语中深层注意力头贡献增强，意大利语中最终层MLP发挥更强补偿作用

Conclusion: 指令微调重新配置深层网络以适应任务要求，组件级策略可能根据语言上下文进行调整

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

<details>

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注直接提示精炼或模型微调，忽视了利用LLM固有推理能力从对比样本中学习的能力

Method: 提出对比推理提示优化(CRPO)框架：1)从HelpSteer2数据集中检索top k参考提示；2)分层对比推理：比较高、中、低质量提示进行反思推理；3)多维度对比推理：分析各评估维度的最佳提示并整合优势

Result: 在HelpSteer2基准测试中，CRPO显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: 对比性、检索增强的推理方法在自动提示优化方面具有巨大潜力，能够实现更鲁棒和可解释的优化

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型评估基于预定义问题集的范式存在与目标交互有限、难度控制不足、评估结果有效性验证困难等挑战，难以精确确定目标模型的知识和能力边界。

Method: 提出JudgeAgent框架，采用知识驱动的数据合成和目标自适应难度调整方法，通过基准评分、交互扩展和评估反馈三个步骤进行扩展测试。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了JudgeAgent及其动态评估范式的有效性，提供了准确有效的评估结果。

Conclusion: JudgeAgent框架能够有效解决传统LLM评估方法的局限性，为精确评估大语言模型的知识和能力边界提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共模态的检索增强生成方法(CMRAG)，能够同时利用文本和图像信息进行高效检索和生成，显著提升了多模态文档问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多模态文档时存在局限：基于布局分析和文本提取的方法只能利用显式文本信息，难以处理图像和非结构化内容；而基于视觉语言模型的方法忽略了文本的语义优势，导致生成结果不理想。

Method: 首先对文档进行结构化解析，获得文本片段和图像区域的共模态表示；然后分别从文本和图像通道检索候选证据，在跨模态检索层面聚合结果；最后提示视觉语言模型基于共模态检索结果生成最终响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉文档问答任务中显著优于纯视觉基础的RAG方法。

Conclusion: 将共模态信息以统一方式整合到RAG框架中是提升复杂文档视觉问答系统性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型偏见缓解策略多以西方为中心，无法有效处理印度特有的称呼和宗教偏见问题。

Method: 提出基于印度宪法第14-17条的平等理念的AMBEDKAR框架，包含宪法意识解码层和特流解码算法，在推理时直接修正偏见输出。以小模型作为偏见生成器，大模型作为宪法指导的验证器。

Conclusion: AMBEDKAR框架能够有效缓解印度特定的社会偏见，为本地化偏见消除提供了一种计算效率高、无需重新训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言NER任务中大型多语言模型微调不可行的问题，探索小规模解码器LM通过元学习实现快速适应和零样本跨语言迁移的可能性。

Method: 使用一阶模型无关元学习（MAML）替代部分自回归目标进行预训练，在Tagalog和Cebuano这两种类型学相似但结构不同的语言上进行测试。

Result: 在4种模型规模（11M-570M）下，MAML使零样本micro-F1在仅头部调优时提升2-6个百分点，全模型调优时提升1-3个百分点，同时收敛时间减少高达8%。

Conclusion: 元学习方法有效提升了小模型在低资源语言NER任务中的性能，特别是在与表面锚点（如Tagalog格助词si/ni）共现的单标记人名实体上表现最佳。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在相同输入提示下往往生成重复单调的输出，特别是在故事生成任务中缺乏创意多样性

Method: Avoidance Decoding策略，通过自适应平衡概念级相似性惩罚（早期阶段优先）和叙事级相似性惩罚（后期阶段加强）来修改token logits

Result: 相比强基线方法，输出多样性提升2.6倍，重复率平均降低30%，同时有效缓解文本退化问题

Conclusion: 该方法能够激活更广泛的神经元，证明其利用了模型的内在创造力，为提升LLM生成多样性提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Conclusion: FActBench基准和一致投票方法为医学领域LLM的事实性评估提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks

We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Motivation: 解决大语言模型存在的幻觉、偏见、隐私问题和计算成本高等限制，这些问题的根源在于将语言能力和事实记忆集中在单一模型中

Method: 评估了135M到32B参数规模的模型在三个维度上的表现：语言能力、外部事实知识和内部事实知识，分析模型规模与不同能力的关系

Result: 发现语言能力和事实知识都随规模增长而提升，但内部事实知识增长更快，表明模型规模更紧密关联记忆能力而非核心语言能力

Conclusion: 支持模块化语言建模方法，使用紧凑的语言能力强的模型作为工具增强系统的基础，FLM范式为更高效、可解释和可持续的NLP解决方案提供了路径

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型是否能够不仅推断人类思维，还能曝露团队对话中的所有视觉盲点和成员间的理解差异。

Method: 采用两步框架：第一步用LLM作为人类风格注释器识别团队对话中的共享心智模型元素；第二步用另一个LLM比较这些注释与人工注释的差异，并建立了一个SMM一致性评估框架。

Result: 形成了人工和LLM注释的数据集、可复现的SMM一致性评估框架，以及基于LLM的差异检测实证分析。结果显示LLM在简单语言注释任务上表现出明显的一致性，但在需要空间推理或语调线索解释的场景中系统性出错。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在团队对话注释和差异检测方面具有潜力，但在复杂的空间推理和语调理解任务中仍面临挑战，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

TL;DR: DCPO提出动态剪切策略和平滑优势标准化技术，解决RLVR框架中的零梯度问题，在多个模型和测试集上实现了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO存在零梯度问题，主要由于固定的标记概率比剪切边界和相同奖励的标准化导致，造成梯度更新无效和生成响应利用不充分。

Method: DCPO采用动态剪切策略，根据标记特定的先验概率自适应调整剪切边界以增强标记级探索；使用平滑优势标准化技术，在累计训练步骤上标准化奖励以提高响应级生成响应的有效利用。

Result: 在四个模型的四个测试集上实现最佳性能：AIME24测试集上46.7/38.8（Avg@1/Avg@32），超过DAPO和GRPO；AIME25测试集上23.3/19.0，同样超过对手。非零优势提升28%，训练效率提升两倍，标记剪切比降低一个数量级。

Conclusion: DCPO能够更有效地利用生成数据进行加强学习，通过动态剪切和平滑标准化技术有效解决了现有方法的限制，在大语言模型的推理能力提升方面发挥了重要作用。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

TL;DR: EmoPerso是一个自监督框架，通过情感感知建模改进人格检测，利用生成机制进行数据增强和表示学习，结合多任务学习和交叉注意力模块，在基准数据集上超越现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人格检测方法严重依赖大规模标注数据集，难以获得高质量人格标签，且大多将情感和人格视为独立变量，忽视了它们之间的相互作用。

Method: 提出EmoPerso框架：1）利用生成机制进行合成数据增强和丰富表示学习；2）提取伪标签情感特征，通过多任务学习与人格预测联合优化；3）使用交叉注意力模块捕捉人格特质与情感表征的细粒度交互；4）采用自学习策略迭代增强模型推理能力。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，EmoPerso超越了最先进的模型。

Conclusion: EmoPerso通过情感感知建模有效提升了人格检测性能，证明了情感与人格之间相互关联的重要性，为自监督人格检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在处理外部标签定义时主要依赖内部参数化知识，而非真正整合外部定义，特别是在通用任务中表现明显，而领域特定任务能从外部定义中获得更多收益


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM是否真正整合外部定义，还是主要依赖其参数化知识来处理任务

Method: 在多个解释基准数据集上进行控制实验，包括通用和领域特定任务，使用专家策划、LLM生成、扰动和交换的定义条件

Result: 显式标签定义能提高准确性和可解释性，但LLM整合外部定义到任务解决过程中既不保证也不一致，模型经常默认使用内部表示，特别是在通用任务中

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解LLM如何处理外部知识与现有能力的关系，模型对外部知识的整合有限且不一致

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

Conclusion: GRAM-R²可作为奖励推理的基础模型，支持下游应用如响应排序和任务特定奖励调优，具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了对滥用的担忧，现有方法忽视风格建模且依赖静态阈值，限制了检测性能

Method: MoSEs框架包含三个核心组件：风格参考库(SRR)、风格感知路由器(SAR)和条件阈值估计器(CTE)，通过动态确定最优阈值进行检测

Result: 相比基线方法平均提升11.34%的检测性能，在低资源情况下提升更显著达39.15%

Conclusion: MoSEs框架通过风格感知的不确定性量化和动态阈值估计，有效提升了AI生成文本检测的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言语义评估的挑战，特别是在印度语言中缺乏高质量基准测试的问题。

Method: 构建包含20,000篇新闻文章的数据集，每篇文章配有4种标题变体（原始、语义相似、词汇相似、无关），使用余弦相似度评估多种句子转换器模型。

Result: 多语言模型表现稳定，而特定语言模型效果参差不齐。数据集还可用于RAG管道评估和其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: 该数据集为印度低资源语言的语义理解提供了有价值的基准资源，支持多种NLP应用场景的评估和改进。

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared

TL;DR: 本研究通过AI重现了Federico Pucci在1931年提出的基于规则机器翻译系统，验证了其方法的有效性，并将这一被遗忘的早期机器翻译先驱重新纳入历史视野。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新发掘和验证Federico Pucci在1929年提出的基于规则机器翻译系统，这一系统在历史上几乎被完全遗忘，从未在创造者之外得到应用。研究旨在通过现代AI技术验证这一早期机器翻译方法的有效性，并确立Pucci在机器翻译历史上的地位。

Method: 使用AI按照Pucci的方法重新翻译1931年文献中记录的两个文本片段：但丁《新生》的意大利语到法语翻译，以及伏尔泰《查第格》的法语到意大利语翻译。然后将验证后的方法扩展到英语、西班牙语和德语的翻译，并应用于更现代的科技文本。

Result: AI按照Pucci方法翻译的结果与94年前的原作相比差异很小，只有轻微变化，验证了该系统的有效性。系统成功扩展到多种语言翻译，结果保持一致。

Conclusion: Pucci的基于规则机器翻译系统经过AI验证确实有效，这一发现不仅确认了Pucci作为机器翻译先驱的历史地位，还重新书写了机器翻译领域的历史，将其与Troyanskij、Booth和Weaver等知名先驱并列。

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

TL;DR: 提出了top-H解码方法，通过熵约束质量最大化来解决LLM在开放文本生成中平衡多样性与逻辑一致性的问题，相比现有方法性能提升显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有截断采样技术（如温度缩放、top-p采样、min-p采样）在有效融入模型置信度方面存在局限，特别是min-p采样仅依赖单个顶部token作为置信度启发式，未能充分利用概率分布信息

Method: 首先建立熵约束最小散度问题的理论框架，证明其等价于NP难的熵约束质量最大化问题，然后提出计算高效的最优算法top-H解码来解决该问题

Result: 在创意写作基准测试中比最先进的min-p采样方法性能提升达25.63%，在GPQA、GSM8K和MT-Bench等问答数据集上保持鲁棒性，LLM作为评判者的评估确认即使在更高温度下也能产生一致输出

Conclusion: top-H解码推进了开放文本生成的最新技术水平，可轻松集成到创意写作应用中，有效平衡了创造性和逻辑一致性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码混合文本（特别是印地语-英语混合语）的命名实体识别面临非正式结构、音译和频繁语言转换等独特挑战，需要评估专用模型与通用模型的性能差异。

Method: 比较评估了代码混合微调模型（HingBERT、HingMBERT、HingRoBERTa）、非代码混合多语言模型（BERT Base Cased、IndicBERT、RoBERTa、MuRIL）以及零样本生成式大语言模型（Google Gemini），使用精确率、召回率和F1分数进行评估。

Result: 代码混合模型，特别是HingRoBERTa和HingBERT微调模型表现最佳，超越了包括Google Gemini在内的闭源LLMs；非代码混合模型表现尚可但适应性有限；Google Gemini在零样本设置下展现出有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 专用领域预训练的代码混合模型在代码混合NER任务中效果最好，但现代LLMs也显示出强大的泛化能力，为专用模型与通用模型的选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在奖励信号稀疏和策略梯度更新不稳定的问题，特别是在基于RL的方法中，需要更稳定高效的训练框架。

Method: 将结果奖励视为可预测标签，将RLVR问题重新表述为对策略模型参数化评分函数的监督学习任务，使用交叉熵损失进行优化，实现隐式的Actor-Critic耦合。

Conclusion: PACS提供了一个简单而强大的框架，为使用可验证奖励进行LLM后训练提供了有前景的途径，实现了更稳定高效的训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

Motivation: 挑战多语言ASR模型优于单语言模型的传统假设，为代表性不足语言提供准确且可在设备上运行的语音识别解决方案。

Method: 使用精心平衡的高质量人类标注数据、伪标签数据和合成数据训练单语言系统，模型规模为27M参数。

Result: 平均错误率比同等大小的Whisper Tiny降低48%，性能超越大9倍的Whisper Small模型，在大多数情况下匹配或超越大28倍的Whisper Medium模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在小模型规模下实现了最先进的性能，为先前支持有限的语言提供了准确的设备端ASR能力，并开源了阿拉伯语、中文、日语、韩语、乌克兰语和越南语模型。

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

TL;DR: DARLING框架通过强化学习同时优化回答质量和语义多样性，解决了大语言模型后训练中准确性与多样性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型后训练过于注重准确性和帮助性，导致输出分布变窄、多样性降低，限制了模型在创意和探索性任务中的实用性。

Method: 提出多样性感知强化学习(DARLING)框架，通过学习的分区函数测量语义多样性，将多样性信号与质量奖励结合进行在线强化学习。

Result: 在非可验证任务(指令跟随和创意写作)和可验证任务(竞赛数学)上，DARLING均优于仅优化质量的基线方法，同时获得更高质量和更新颖的输出。

Conclusion: 显式优化多样性能够促进在线强化学习中的探索，从而产生更高质量的响应，证明质量与多样性可以协同优化。

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as

*Fakhraddin Alwajih,Abdellah El Mekki,Hamdy Mubarak,Majd Hawasly,Abubakr Mohamed,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PalmX 2025是首个针对LLMs在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域文化能力的基准测试，包含阿拉伯文化和伊斯兰文化两个子任务，通过多选题评估模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs预训练数据主要来自网络，偏向高资源语言和西方文化，导致对阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化的理解不足，需要专门的基准测试来评估和改进这种文化能力差距。

Method: 设计了包含多选题的两个子任务：通用阿拉伯文化和通用伊斯兰文化，涵盖22个阿拉伯国家的传统、食物、历史、宗教实践和语言表达等广泛主题。

Result: 任务特定微调显著提升性能，最佳系统在文化问题上达到72.15%准确率，在伊斯兰知识上达到84.22%。参数高效微调是最主流有效的方法，数据增强的效果则依赖于具体领域。

Conclusion: 该共享任务成功建立了LLMs文化能力的基准，证明了针对性微调的重要性，为改善LLMs在 underrepresented 文化领域的表现提供了重要见解和方法论。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证，达到优越性能同时显著降低模型复杂度

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署问题，验证了其有效性和灵活性

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Motivation: 传统的微表情输入模态（如Apex Frame、光流、动态图像）无法充分捐捉细微而瞬间的面部微动，导致识别性能不佳。

Method: 提出MESTI输入模态，将视频序列转换为单张图像保留微动特征；设计MEGANet网络，包含梯度注意力块来提取细粒度运动特征。

Result: 在VGG19、ResNet50和EfficientNetB0上，MESTI都显著超过现有输入模态；MEGANet网络在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到了最高准确率，创造了新的标杆。

Conclusion: MESTI是一种优越的输入模态，MEGANet是一个先进的识别网络，为微表情识别系统的应用开启了新路径。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

Motivation: 生成真实的稀疏多类别3D体素结构面临两个主要挑战：体素结构的立方内存缩放问题，以及由稀疏性导致的显著类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将体素视为token，使用离散扩散语言模型来生成3D体素结构，将离散扩散模型从文本等序列领域扩展到空间连贯的3D结构生成。

Result: 在3D-Craft数据集的Minecraft房屋结构上评估，相比之前的基线方法和自回归公式，Scaffold Diffusion能够产生更真实和连贯的结构，即使在超过98%稀疏度的数据上训练也能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 离散扩散为3D稀疏体素生成建模提供了一个有前景的框架，能够有效处理高度稀疏的3D结构生成问题。

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出SGLC框架解决高分辨率图像去雾问题，通过全局特征生成器和局部特征增强器的组合，在保持全局上下文的同时增强局部细节，显著提升高分辨率去雾性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾模型主要针对低分辨率图像，处理高分辨率图像时性能下降严重，需要同时兼顾全局上下文信息和局部精细细节。

Method: 提出SGLC框架，包含全局特征生成器(GFG)产生初步去雾结果，局部特征增强器(LFE)细化局部细节，可集成到任何去雾网络中。

Result: 在高分辨率数据集上PSNR指标显著提升，证明SGLC能有效处理大规模雾化图像。

Conclusion: SGLC是模型无关的全局-局部特征融合机制，能同时利用场景级线索和细粒度细节，显著提高高分辨率环境下的视觉保真度。

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了首个大规模自监督肾脏异常检测模型，用于药物安全性评估。研究发现UNI基础模型的特征提取不足以检测异常，但通过自监督方法可以取得优于随机的结果，有望用于排除正常切片，降低药物开发成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾脏异常检测是临床前药物开发的关键环节，但传统方法需要人工检查数百至数千张全切片图像，耗时耗力且成本高昂。大多数切片都是正常的，需要检测细微的毒性变化。

Method: 使用来自158种化合物的药物安全性评估研究数据，探索UNI基础模型的特征提取能力。比较了简单的k近邻分类器和自监督方法在相同特征上的表现。

Result: k近邻分类器表现接近随机水平，表明仅靠基础模型生成的特征不足以检测异常。自监督方法取得了优于随机的结果，ROC曲线下面积为0.62，阴性预测值达到89%。

Conclusion: 自监督方法在肾脏异常检测方面显示出潜力，经过进一步开发可用于排除正常切片，显著降低药物安全性评估的时间和成本。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在文本和图像表示空间存在模态差距，限制了检索性能，需要弥合这种差距

Method: 1. 使用生成扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询；2. 使用视觉模型估计图像间相似度；3. 引入聚合网络将多个生成图像融合为单一向量表示，并融合两种查询模态的相似度分数

Result: 经过广泛评估，该方法在文本到图像检索任务中始终优于仅依赖文本查询的检索方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了视觉编码器、VLM和文本到图像生成模型的最新进展，成功弥合了模态差距，提升了检索性能

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)会无意中推断和泄露敏感的生物特征信息（如种族、性别、年龄等），这在现实应用和社会敏感领域存在严重隐私问题，但目前缺乏公开的评估基准和数据集来解决这一问题

Method: 1) 创建PRISM基准，用于评估MLLMs在两个方面的表现：拒绝生物特征相关查询和在一般响应中避免隐含生物特征泄露；2) 对LLaVA数据集进行详细审计，发现广泛存在的生物特征泄露；3) 构建Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统性地从LLaVA数据集中移除显性和隐性生物特征信息

Result: 评估显示不同MLLMs在各种生物特征属性上都存在泄露问题，揭示了详细的隐私违规情况。在Safe-LLaVA数据集上微调的模型显著减少了生物特征泄露

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA和PRISM为MLLMs的隐私对齐开发和评估设立了新标准，提供了首个隐私保护的多模态训练数据集和评估基准

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在静态场景理解方面表现出色，但在动态开放环境中的时空推理和任务导向导航方面存在局限，主要由于对细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解的建模不足。

Method: 提出VEME框架，包含三个核心组件：跨模态对齐框架连接对象、空间表示和视觉语义；动态隐式认知地图实现任务相关的几何语义记忆召回；基于指令的导航推理框架利用具身先验进行长期规划和高效探索。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，VEME方法有效增强了模型在动态未知环境中的泛化能力，为具身智能的时空推理和导航任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

Result: 多模态方法优于单模态基线，ConvNeXt和ResNet18在AUC-ROC上分别达到0.9427和0.9349，F1分数分别为0.6720和0.7294。

Conclusion: 多模态AI有潜力作为非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要活检，改善乳腺肿瘤管理的临床决策。

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FHT2SP算法，一种快速且高精度的霍夫变换算法，在保持常数有界误差的同时实现了接近最优的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有快速霍夫变换算法要么计算复杂度高但精度有限（误差随图像尺寸增大而恶化），要么精度高但计算成本接近立方复杂度。需要一种既能保持高精度又具有高效计算复杂度的算法。

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，将其扩展到任意形状（突破原始2的幂次方限制），并将其集成到FHT2DT算法中。通过适当选择超像素尺寸来控制精度和效率。

Result: FHT2SP算法实现了接近最优的计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持近似误差由与图像尺寸无关的常数界定，且可通过元参数控制。

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法成功解决了霍夫变换中计算效率与精度之间的权衡问题，为各种应用领域提供了既快速又高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统遇到噪声、材料变异性和非控制拍照条件的挑战，传统边缘检测器和手工管道效果有限。

Method: 系统分为三个阶段：数据获取和预处理、使用条件GAN进行轮廓生成、通过视觉-语言模型进行多模态轮廓精细化。采用人在循环过程制作标准化提示词。

Result: 在FabTrack数据集上，系统提高了轮廓保真度，改善了边缘连续性和几何对齐，减少了手工追踪。GPT-image-1在结构准确性和感知质量方面均超过Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了VLM导向的生成式工作流在推进工业计算机视觉领域超越传统管道限制方面的潜力。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出LIMO方法，通过信息最大化损失和参数高效微调策略，显著提升transductive few-shot CLIP性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前transductive few-shot learning在视觉-语言基础模型中的研究处于起步阶段，需要专门针对VLMs的方法来挖掘transductive学习的潜力

Method: 提出语言感知信息最大化(LIMO)损失，包含三个互补项：视觉输入与文本类别描述的互信息、KL散度惩罚项、基于标注样本的标准交叉熵损失；探索参数高效微调策略

Result: LIMO大幅超越近期transductive few-shot CLIP方法，相比最佳inductive方法也有显著提升

Conclusion: 信息理论概念和参数高效微调策略在transductive few-shot设置中具有巨大潜力，LIMO为VLMs的transductive学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Motivation: 计算组织病理学中的域泛化受到全玻片图像异质性的阻碍，而病理学家依赖跨域不变的形态学线索进行诊断。受此启发，研究者假设显式建模生物学上稳健的核形态和空间组织能够学习对域偏移具有弹性的癌症表征。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法，在监督对比学习框架中整合组织病理学图像、增强和核分割掩码，通过对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表示来优先考虑诊断特征。还结合随机权重平均(SWA)来增强分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MorphGen不仅解决了数字病理学中当前深度学习系统的关键脆弱性，还通过生物学启发的形态学建模实现了强大的域泛化性能，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大型多模态模型的视觉token剪枝策略，通过互信息保持跨模态对齐和最大化嵌入空间距离保持信息多样性，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算量和提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型中视觉token编码导致token数量激增，显著增加计算和内存成本。现有剪枝方法存在校准成本高或重要性度量不优的问题，导致保留冗余token

Method: 专门针对视觉token进行剪枝，提出基于互信息的剪枝策略移除与文本token语义不对齐的视觉token，同时通过最大化嵌入空间中的期望成对距离来剪枝冗余视觉token，使用贪心算法高效求解

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B等模型上实现了88.9%的token减少，推理速度提升56.7%，同时保持了强性能表现

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态模型中视觉token冗余问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了模型性能，为高效多模态推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Conclusion: 这项工作开启了在未见数据的目标环境中部署健壁模型的新途径，证明实际中常被忽视的文本元数据具有重要价值。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Motivation: HSI去噪是后续处理的关键预处理步骤。干净的HSI通常存在于低维子空间中，可以通过低秩和稀疏表示来捕获，但如何充分使用这种物理特性进行有效去噪同时保留图像细节是一个挑战。

Method: 提出迭代低秩网络(ILRNet)，在U-Net架构中嵌入秩最小化模块(RMM)。该模块将特征图转换到小波域，对低频分量应用奇异值阈值处理(SVT)，利用特征域中HSI的光谱低秩性。参数从数据中自适应学习，并通过迭代细化过程自适应结合中间去噪结果和噪声输入。

Conclusion: ILRNet成功整合了模型驱动和数据驱动方法的优势，通过自适应学习参数和迭代细化过程，能够灵活有效地捕获不同场景下的低秩特性，实现渐进增强和优异的图像细节保留。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Conclusion: SurgLLM框架有效解决了手术视频理解中的空间和时间挑战，为多功能计算机辅助手术系统提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Abstract: We describe a publicly available multimodal dataset of annotated Positron
Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies for head and neck
cancer research. The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients
with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10
international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered
PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical
diversity across institutions. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved
lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists
and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control
measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with
expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a
subset of patients, and comprehensive clinical metadata. This metadata includes
TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up
outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We
demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks:
automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV
status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep
learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic
frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文推翻了现有关于目标幻觉的假设，提出遗漏幻觉和虚构幻觉具有不同成因，并基于视觉-语义注意力势场理论开发了VPFC方法，有效减少遗漏幻觉而不增加虚构幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于错误假设，认为遗漏和虚构幻觉有共同成因，往往在减少遗漏的同时引发更多虚构。本文旨在揭示这两种幻觉的不同机制并开发更有效的缓解策略。

Method: 通过视觉注意力干预实验发现视觉-语义注意力势场机制，提出Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC)方法，这是一种即插即用的幻觉缓解技术。

Result: VPFC方法有效减少了遗漏幻觉，同时没有引入额外的虚构幻觉，证明了两种幻觉成因分离的理论正确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前目标幻觉研究的关键疏忽，为开发更鲁棒和平衡的幻觉缓解策略指明了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个针对视觉语言模型的两阶段防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化来增强模型对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示来提取有害方向，性能不佳且可能降低视觉定位性能，需要更有效的防御方案。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段从多样化数据源计算自适应层特定引导向量，第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化过程细化这些向量，整合自动毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励。

Result: 实验表明SPO-VLM通过激活引导和偏好优化增强了安全性，同时在良性任务上保持强性能且不损害视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: SPO-VLM提供了一个平衡效率和有效性的防御框架，将轻量级缓解基础与深度策略优化相结合，为VLM安全防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应点提示调优（APPT）方法，通过点嵌入和提示生成器直接利用点云特征来校准异构基础模型，实现无需异构映射的点云处理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于点云数据稀缺，预训练大型3D模型具有挑战性。现有方法通过"高到低"映射将预训练视觉模型应用于3D领域，但会导致空间几何信息丢失且缺乏通用框架

Method: 将原始点云转换为点嵌入以捕获空间特征，使用排列不变特征处理点云无序性，引入共享权重的提示生成器动态产生点提示，与冻结的基础模型拼接

Result: 该方法能够以少量参数微调预训练模型，直接处理点云数据，保持空间几何信息，并为异构数据提供丰富的全局结构信息

Conclusion: APPT方法为任何模态到3D点云分析的跨域自注意力校准提供了通用解决方案，减少了计算开销，避免了异构映射的信息损失

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

TL;DR: 通过在正向渡过程中部分结合两个不同类别的估计噪声，NoiseCutMix方法能够生成自然、高分辨率的图像，合并两个类别的特征，提高分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CutMix等多类图像结合数据增帽方法存在边界不自然的问题，需要一种能够生成自然融合多类特征的高质量图像增帽方法。

Method: 在涵数模型的正向渡过程中，部分结合两个不同类别的估计噪声，利用涵数模型的高质量图像生成能力和CutMix的特征融合特性，创造自然的多样化增帽数据。

Result: 在分类实验中，NoiseCutMix在效果上超过了传统多类图像结合数据增帽方法、随机图像生成方法以及这些方法的组合。

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix通过涵数模型与CutMix的融合，能够生成自然高清的多类特征融合图像，为数据增帽提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

TL;DR: 提出两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法UDAKD和FSKD，利用自动驾驶场景中相机和LiDAR的时空同步数据，通过2D-3D对应关系将预训练2D图像模型的知识迁移到3D点云分割，无需3D标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D LiDAR点云语义分割需要大量标注数据，成本高昂且耗时。相比之下，真实世界图像数据集更容易获得且规模更大。

Method: 使用无监督域适应知识蒸馏(UDAKD)和基于特征与语义的知识蒸馏(FSKD)，利用2D-3D对应关系对齐3D网络输出与2D网络对应点，在3D点云上部署自校准卷积作为域适应模块基础。

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的有效性，在性能上持续超越该领域最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过跨模态知识蒸馏可以有效减少3D点云标注的需求，同时保持模态通用信息并过滤模态特定细节，为自动驾驶中的3D LiDAR语义分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决叙事研究中研究人员和参与者面临的双重负担：需要将各种数据转化为连贯故事形式，以及进行大量文档的成员检查，需要更高效和参与者友好的叙事制作方法

Method: 开发了NAME范式，包含演员定位和形状模块来促进合理的图像生成，并设计了一套包含三个关键维度的评估指标来客观衡量生成角色的感知质量和叙事一致性

Result: 在不同数据划分方案下均达到最先进性能：仅用0.96%数据就将FID分数从195降至152；在相同数据量下，70:30划分时FID从175降至152，95:5划分时从96降至49；新指标得分3.62超越基线的2.66

Conclusion: NAME范式是推动叙事研究领域的首次尝试，能有效减轻研究人员和参与者的认知负担，为叙事制作和表征提供了更高效的方法

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

TL;DR: HERO-VQL是一种针对第一人称视觉查询定位的新方法，通过自上而下的注意力引导和增强一致性训练，有效处理视角变化和遮挡问题，在VQ2D数据集上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第一人称视频中频繁且突然的视角变化导致物体外观变化显著和部分遮挡，使现有方法难以实现精确定位。

Method: 提出HERO-VQL方法，包含：1）自上而下的注意力引导（TAG），利用类别token获取高级上下文和主成分得分图进行细粒度定位；2）基于自我中心增强的一致性训练（EgoACT），通过替换查询对象和重排视频帧来增强查询多样性并模拟极端视角变化。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的广泛实验验证了HERO-VQL能有效处理第一人称挑战，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL受人类认知过程启发，通过创新的注意力机制和增强训练策略，成功解决了第一人称视觉查询定位中的关键挑战。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型(DCDM)用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数数量，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建具有减少患者辐射暴露和缩短检查时间的潜力，但会导致噪声增加和图像细节减少，降低图像质量。需要一种灵活的方法来适应不同剂量水平。

Method: DCDM模型包含两个约束模块：核变换器约束(NTC)利用核范数作为矩阵秩最小化的近似，将低秩特性整合到Transformer架构中；编码连接约束(ENC)利用压缩特征表示来编码和控制预训练扩散模型。NTC从低剂量图像中提取信息并转换为潜在空间的压缩特征表示，ENC使用这些表示来获得像素空间的重建图像。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)方面优于最先进方法，并且在未知DRF场景下具有良好的泛化能力，即使在超低剂量水平(如全剂量的1%)也证明有价值。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束控制器有效减少了可训练参数数量，能够灵活适应不同剂量水平，在超低剂量PET重建中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Motivation: 全景视频广角视野常包含不需要的物体，现有视频修复方法主要针对普通窄视野视频，无法处理等距柱状投影带来的畸变问题。

Method: 提出DAOVI深度学习模型，包含基于测地距离的图像空间运动评估模块和针对几何畸变的深度感知特征传播模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在定量和定性评估上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI模型有效解决了全景视频修复中的几何畸变问题，为全景视频处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: 通过视频生成模型提供的多视角监督信号能够有效丰富细节表现并减少伪影，提升单目视频人体avatar重建质量

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练即可加速现有视觉语言模型推理的方法，通过分层令牌合并和KV缓存压缩技术，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在推理过程中存在编码和解码阶段的计算效率问题，特别是在处理长序列时延迟较高，需要一种无需重新训练的高效加速方法。

Method: 将VLM推理分为编码和解码两个阶段：编码阶段使用金字塔令牌合并技术分层减少令牌数量；解码阶段采用KV缓存压缩技术移除不必要的缓存以提高网络吞吐量。

Result: 仅保留35%图像令牌时可保持100%性能，仅保留3%图像令牌时仍保持约98%性能。网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍，长序列生成时推理时间减少3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM能够在不损失性能的情况下显著加速大型视觉语言模型的推理速度，使重型模型比小型模型推理更快，有望促进实际部署应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative

effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

*Lubin Gan,Xiaoman Wu,Jing Zhang,Zhifeng Wang,Linhao Qu,Siying Wu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemaMIL是一个新的多实例学习方法，通过语义重排序和语义引导检索状态空间模块，在计算病理学中实现了最先进的准确率，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力MIL方法忽视上下文关系，Transformer模型计算成本高且容易过拟合，状态空间模型虽然计算复杂度低但打乱补丁顺序会破坏组织学意义。

Method: 提出SemaMIL框架，包含语义重排序(SR)方法对语义相似的补丁进行聚类和顺序排列，以及语义引导检索状态空间模块(SRSM)选择代表性查询子集来调整状态空间参数。

Result: 在四个WSI亚型数据集上的评估显示，SemaMIL相比强基线方法实现了最先进的准确率，同时使用更少的FLOPs和参数。

Conclusion: SemaMIL成功解决了现有MIL方法在计算病理学中的局限性，在保持组织学可解释性的同时提高了性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

*Bo Wu,Zhiqi Ai,Jun Jiang,Congcong Zhu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SA-LDL算法，通过分阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数，有效解决年龄估计中的标签模糊性问题，在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别达到1.74和2.15的MAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过标签分布学习建模相邻年龄组的相关性，但忽略了不同年龄阶段存在不同程度的标签模糊性。

Method: 提出阶段自适应标签分布学习(SA-LDL)算法，基于锚点与所有其他年龄的嵌入相似性分析，发现标签模糊性呈现明显的阶段性模式，采用阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数。

Result: 在MORPH-II数据集上MAE为1.74，在FG-NET数据集上MAE为2.15，表现出竞争性性能。

Conclusion: SA-LDL能够有效捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构化特征，实现更准确和鲁棒的年龄估计。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络在图像配准中的双重作用分析，提出了Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR)框架，通过分离特征学习和光流估计，在多个数据集上实现了更好的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于学习的可变形图像配准中计算复杂度高和大变形处理困难的问题，分析CNN在配准中的具体作用机制。

Method: 提出EOIR框架，使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取，配合3层光流估计器构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，在大变形模型下逐步组合微分同胚变形。

Result: 在5个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证了有效性，实现了优越的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡，在可比精度下提供更好的效率和平滑度。

Conclusion: EOIR框架通过分析CNN在配准中的线性化和对比度协调作用，成功实现了计算效率和大变形处理的改进，代码将开源。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on
https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

*Zhihong Zhang,Xiaojian Huang,Jin Xu,Zhuodong Luo,Xinzhi Wang,Jiansheng Wei,Xuejin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是首个全面的视频多模态奖励模型评估基准，涵盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个维度，包含1,563个高质量标注样本，评估了28个模型，发现当前最佳模型准确率仅57.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态奖励模型评估基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评估维度不全面等问题，需要构建更全面的评估体系来推动该领域发展。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建包含1,563个标注样本的高质量偏好数据集，每个样本包含视频-文本提示、选择响应和拒绝响应的三元组，覆盖4个核心视频理解维度。

Result: 评估28个多模态奖励模型，最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到57.0%准确率，开源最佳模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B为53.3%。发现RL训练不一定带来更好的跨模态泛化，推理时缩放对多数模型有益，视频帧数变化对不同类型模型影响不同。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域多模态奖励模型的评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性并提供了重要洞察。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了STVH和M-STVH两种视频哈希技术，用于细粒度群体活动检索，能够同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，在复杂场景中实现高效视频检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂场景中视频数据的爆炸式增长，快速检索群体活动成为迫切需求。现有方法只能对整个视频进行检索，无法实现活动粒度的检索。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉时空演化特征。M-STVH作为增强版本，通过多焦点表示学习实现层次特征集成，同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上的对比实验表明，STVH和M-STVH都能取得优异的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的STVH和M-STVH技术有效解决了细粒度群体活动检索问题，能够适应不同检索需求，在复杂视频场景中表现出色。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST是一个针对超声图像的双流框架，通过token驱动机制选择合适的目标域风格特征，在保持源内容的同时转换风格，提升下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同设备采集的超声图像存在风格差异，导致下游任务性能下降。现有UI2I方法未能充分考虑过滤最相关的风格特征，可能导致转换后的图像与下游任务需求不匹配

Method: 提出TRUST框架：1）Token-dRiven模块从数据视角选择合适的目标token，从模型视角识别最优目标token；2）在源编码器中注入辅助提示以匹配下游行为的内容表示；3）使用行为镜像损失指导

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有UI2I方法

Conclusion: TRUST通过token驱动的双流框架有效解决了超声图像风格转换问题，在保持内容完整性的同时实现了更好的风格迁移效果

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI即服务(AIaaS)的兴起使得预训练模型通过API普及，但黑盒模型不暴露权重、训练数据或logits，当前领域自适应方法无法适用

Method: 提出ATGC方法，利用DINOv2注意力图动态选择最优尺度进行黑盒模型推理，通过熵评分识别信息丰富的尺度进行伪标签蒸馏

Result: 在多个数据集上仅使用one-hot API预测就实现了黑盒监督下的显著性能提升

Conclusion: ATGC方法有效解决了黑盒模型蒸馏中的分辨率诅咒问题，为实际AIaaS场景中的模型适应提供了可行方案

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

Motivation: 现有CISS方法存在灾难性语义纠缠问题，包括原型-特征纠缠和背景-增量纠缠，导致显著噪声和错误

Method: 语言引导的引导解耦框架(LBD)，包含语言引导原型解耦和流形互背景解耦，使用软提示调优和编码器适配

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上实现最先进性能，特别是在多步场景中表现优异

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，通过语言引导的特征解耦显著提升了增量学习性能

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现优异，但在未校准模态（特别是MRI）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向的差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出BrainFM模型，采用"轻度到重度"的受试者内生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观变化（模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估，BrainFM在图像合成、解剖分割、头皮到皮层距离、偏置场估计和配准等五个基础脑成像任务中均表现出强大的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM作为一个模态无关的基础模型，能够直接应用于多种脑成像任务，解决了现有方法在未校准模态中泛化能力差的问题，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在具有挑战性的视觉领域（如车辆损伤评估）中，细粒度目标检测对人类专家来说都很困难。虽然DiffusionDet通过条件去噪扩散取得了进展，但其在上下文相关场景中的性能仍受限于局部特征条件化

Method: 引入Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)，利用交叉注意力机制将全局场景上下文与局部提案特征直接集成。使用单独的专用编码器生成全局上下文，捕获全面的环境信息，使每个目标提案都能关注场景级理解

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中相比最先进模型有显著改进，为细粒度领域中的上下文感知目标检测建立了新的性能基准

Conclusion: 该框架通过使每个目标提案能够关注全面的环境信息，显著增强了生成式检测范式的性能，在细粒度目标检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型从自然图像领域迁移到遥感分割任务时的挑战，包括遥感数据集类别多样性有限以及自然图像与遥感图像之间的领域差距问题。

Method: 1) 全局-局部解耦模块：使用NLP技术将文本输入分解为局部类别名词和全局修饰语，通过无监督掩码提议网络将图像输入划分为类别无关的掩码提议；2) 局部尺度对齐：通过上下文感知裁剪策略提取图像块，并引入遥感特定知识丰富文本输入；3) 全局尺度对齐：提出跨尺度Grad-CAM模块利用全局修饰语的上下文信息精炼Grad-CAM图，通过掩码选择模块将像素级激活集成到掩码级分割输出中。

Result: 实现了遥感图像的开集语义分割(OVSS)和参考表达式分割(RES)，提供了准确且可解释的全局和局部维度对齐。

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架成功解决了视觉语言模型在遥感分割任务中的迁移挑战，通过解耦和对齐策略实现了无需训练的高效分割性能。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Conclusion: 该研究为甲烷排放检测提供了一种更简化的方法，避免了复杂的预处理流程，同时保持了检测性能，为卫星端机器学习应用提供了新的可行性。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the

Motivation: 现有的基于注意力机制的transformer在多视角3D人体姿态估计中存在两个主要问题：难以准确建模关键点的空间排列（特别是在遮挡场景下），以及容易过拟合训练数据中的特定相机配置和视觉场景，导致在新设置中性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出MV-SSM框架，在两个不同层次上显式建模关节空间序列：多视角图像的特征层和人体关键点层。使用投影状态空间(PSS)块通过状态空间建模学习关节空间排列的泛化表示，并改进Mamba的传统扫描为网格令牌引导的双向扫描(GTBS)。

Result: 在多个实验中表现出强大的泛化能力：在CMU Panoptic的三相机设置上AP25提升10.8(+24%)，在变化相机配置上AP25提升7.0(+13%)，在跨数据集评估的Campus A1上PCP提升15.3(+38%)。

Conclusion: MV-SSM框架通过创新的状态空间建模和扫描机制，有效解决了多视角3D人体姿态估计中的泛化问题，在多个挑战性场景下显著优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上存在明显不足，这源于单一视觉编码器的架构限制

Method: 提出FtZ视觉塔框架，通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚定编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器创新性组合

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要细粒度视觉理解的基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，在多个真实基准测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值数据和难以从未标注真实数据中学习的挑战。现有方法依赖合成数据存在域差距，或违反光度假设

Method: 提出Selecting-Tuning-Maintaining (STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重，自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向进行初始化，并施加主方向正则化

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用恶劣天气合成数据训练的方法，甚至超过了深度基础模型

Conclusion: STM策略能够在保持预训练模型泛化能力的同时实现灵活的任务适应，为恶劣天气条件下的深度估计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Motivation: 挖掘评分模型的潜力，挑战传统上评分模型和策略模型分离的设计理念，尝试构建既能评价又能生成的统一模型。

Method: 将偏好标签的评分数据集重新组织为可验证训练信号，对基础生成模型进行强化学习训练，生成LLaVA-Critic-R1模型。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1在26个视觉理解和理解测试中表现突出，平均提升5.7%，MMMU任务达到71.9的SOTA性能。测试时自我评价能够带来平均13.8%的提升。

Conclusion: 通过RL训练评分数据可以构建既能评价又能生成的统一模型，为可扩展的自我改进多模态系统提供了简单有效的路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以建模长距离空间-光谱特征依赖关系。Mamba虽能解决计算复杂度问题，但无法直接进行特征融合。

Method: 设计预处理模块适配Mamba结构，结合CNN提取多层特征；创新设计基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块实现双模态特征充分融合；构建结合Mamba和CNN优势的更强主干网络。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在降低网络训练负担的前提下，实验效果优于Transformer。

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络成功利用了Mamba的低计算负担优势，探索了多模态特征融合的内部结构潜力，实现了更强的全图像理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Conclusion: CascadeFormer为骨架动作识别提供了有效的Transformer解决方案，并开源代码和模型检查点以促进可复现性

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

Motivation: 当前对视觉-语言模型中关键的投影层在未见概念上的泛化能力缺乏系统性评估，需要一个标准化的测试框架来量化其泛化性能。

Method: 重新构造物体检测数据集为提示格式，设计训练/测试集分离（标签集互斠），通过机制解释方法分析投影层的工作机理。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Conclusion: 提出的公平性算法有效解决了皮肤病变分类中的肤色偏见问题，提供了一种不依赖传统统计方法的实用解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，为视觉稀疏自编码器特征提供更准确的因果解释，揭示传统激活位置分析可能导致的误解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅通过检查特征激活最高的图像块来理解稀疏自编码器特征，但由于自注意力机制在整个图像上混合信息，激活位置往往与特征触发相关但并非因果关系，可能导致错误解释

Method: 提出因果特征解释(CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)和输入归因技术，将每个SAE特征激活视为目标，识别真正因果驱动该激活的图像块

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF映射经常与朴素激活映射不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系（如"咆哮面孔"特征需要眼睛和鼻子同时出现，而不仅仅是张开的嘴）。补丁插入测试证实CaFE比基于激活排序的补丁更有效地恢复或抑制特征激活

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的视觉SAE特征解释，强调了仅依赖激活位置进行解释的风险，为理解视觉Transformer中的特征表示提供了更可靠的因果分析方法

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的方法对于复杂真实世界图像理解是有效的

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal

through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical

and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined

efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single

Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现检测变换器在人类-物体交互检测中存在"有毒兄弟"偏差问题，并提出两种新的去偏学习目标来显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测变换器在人类-物体交互检测中取得了显著进展，但研究发现存在"有毒兄弟"偏差问题，即大量相似但不同的HOI三元组在交互解码器的输入和输出端相互干扰和竞争，阻碍了学习效果

Method: 提出两种去偏学习目标：1）"对比后校准"-采样兄弟类错误HOI三元组并通过强位置先验重构为正确三元组；2）"合并后拆分"-先学习兄弟类别间的共享特征以区分其他组，再显式细化组内差异以保持独特性

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HICO-Det数据集上比基线提升9.18% mAP，比现有最先进方法提升3.59% mAP，在各种设置下均显著优于其他方法

Conclusion: 提出的两种去偏学习目标有效解决了"有毒兄弟"偏差问题，显著提升了人类-物体交互检测的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Conclusion: InterPose数据集解决了人体-物体交互数据稀缺问题，为生成真实交互动作提供了重要资源，推动了计算机图形学和机器人学中交互动画的发展

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Motivation: 现代面部检索系统常将检索阶段外包给第三方，导致用户照片隐私风险。虽然同态加密提供了强安全保障，但其计算效率低下不适合实时应用。

Method: 提出了一个分层两阶段框架：（1）高速通量可变注销PQ索引模块用于快速候选筛选，（2）细粒度密文空间检索模块用于最终精确面部排名。设计了专门的保护机制来保护索引模块。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在效果、效率和安全性之间实现了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效的安全面部表征检索方案，有效解决了同态加密计算效率低的问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Conclusion: AAGLSD提供了一种高效且精确的线段检测解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

Motivation: 现有视觉假体在脑编码阶段生成的脑信号缺乏足够的生物相似性，且缺乏真实脑响应的监督信号来验证预测刺激的生物合理性

Method: 使用预训练的CLIP视觉编码器提取图像语义表示，结合交叉注意力增强的U-Net扩散模型，通过迭代去噪学习重建生物合理的脑信号

Result: 在THINGS-EEG2和THINGS-MEG多模态数据集上验证了框架有效性，可视化展示了被试内和被试间的M/EEG信号变化

Conclusion: 提出的交叉注意力机制能够实现视觉特征与脑信号表示之间的动态交互，促进生成过程中的细粒度对齐，提高了生成脑信号的生物合理性

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

TL;DR: OmniReason框架通过联合建模动态3D环境及其决策过程，解决了现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中忽视时间维度的问题，在时空推理和可解释性方面取得显著进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽略了真实驾驶场景中至关重要的时间维度，这限制了自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的表现。

Method: 提出OmniReason框架：1) 构建大规模VLA数据集OmniReason-Data，采用幻觉缓解的自动标注管道确保物理合理性和时间一致性；2) 开发OmniReason-Agent架构，集成稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器，通过时空知识蒸馏捕获时空因果推理模式。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中实现最先进性能，显著提升了自动驾驶系统在复杂动态环境中的时空推理能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架成功建立了强大的时空推理能力，为可解释、时间感知的自动驾驶系统在复杂动态环境中运行提供了新的能力基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG是一个多模态迭代检索增强生成框架，通过迭代检索和推理来提升知识密集型视觉问答的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在需要外部知识的视觉问答任务上表现有限，传统的单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，利用累积推理记录动态生成多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并将新知识整合到推理记录中迭代优化

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等挑战性基准测试中，MI-RAG显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确率

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答中的组合推理提供了一种可扩展的方法

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Method: 在多模态交叉知识基础上，为每个高斯基元嵌入额外语义特征，使用CLIP提取的语义特征进行监督，并采用分阶段训练策略（从粗到细学习+后期参数优化）

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和Submerged3D数据集上全面超越现有方法，PSNR平均提升达3.09 dB

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的候选方案，实现了语义和结构感知的高保真水下场景重建

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Conclusion: 该模块具有内容自适应能力，用物理信息变换替代随机预处理，通过多视图融合提高对异质性图像的验证性，为医学图像分析建立了新范式

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

Result: 相比现有SOTA方法，SDM展现出更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益，并能与对抗训练方法结合提升防御效果

Conclusion: SDM方法通过创新的优化框架和损失函数设计，有效提升了对抗攻击的效率和效果，为模型鲁棒性评估提供了有力工具

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is

Motivation: 传统纹理缺陷检测方法在复杂纹理和噪声环境下性能有限，需要结合局部特征和全局处理能力来提升检测效果

Method: 使用U-Net进行局部特征训练，结合Vision Transformer进行全局处理，采用高斯滤波器损失函数去除背景噪声，SP掩码强化纹理-缺陷边界，Gabor滤波器后处理突出缺陷方向频率特征

Conclusion: 该方法通过多技术融合有效提升了纹理表面缺陷检测性能，在噪声环境下表现出良好的鲁棒性

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的端到端优化框架，通过将相机位姿作为可学习参数与3D高斯属性结合，来解决单目视频中动态3D场景重建因运动模糊导致的位姿估计误差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态3D场景重建方法通常采用两步流程：先估计相机位姿，再优化3D高斯。但由于运动模糊会破坏位姿估计，导致位姿误差累积，最终产生较差的重建结果。

Method: 将相机和物体运动重新表述为3D高斯的每个基元的SE(3)仿射变换，制定统一的优化目标。采用三阶段训练策略：先固定位姿训练3D高斯，然后固定高斯优化位姿，最后联合优化所有参数。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实世界序列上的大量实验表明，该方法在重建质量和位姿估计精度方面相比先前的动态去模糊方法取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过统一的端到端优化框架，将相机位姿与3D高斯属性联合优化，有效解决了运动模糊导致的位姿估计问题，显著提升了动态3D场景重建的质量和精度。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Conclusion: SegDINO在最小化可训练参数的同时保持了基础特征的表示能力，为高效分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将单视图新视角合成分解为360度场景外推和视角插值的两阶段方法，通过全景扩散模型和视频扩散模型生成全局一致的新视角


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像新视角合成中由于大范围未观测区域导致的视角一致性差、长距离轨迹和闭环场景中视图对齐不正确的问题

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用全景扩散模型从输入图像学习场景先验，生成360度全景；2) 从全景中采样并扭曲关键帧，通过预训练视频扩散模型和空间噪声扩散过程生成新视角

Result: 在多样化场景数据集上的实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成连贯视图方面优于现有方法，即使在闭环场景中也能保持全局一致性

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解策略和关键帧条件化，有效解决了单视图新视角合成的长期视图和场景一致性问题，同时支持灵活的相机控制

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQAT是一种面向平坦性的量化感知训练方法，通过层冻结机制和自适应算法解决QAT在分布外数据上性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前QAT方法主要关注分布内数据性能，忽视了分布外数据的性能退化问题。研究发现QAT导致损失景观尖锐化，与平坦损失景观有利于OOD泛化的观点相矛盾。

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）引入层级冻结机制缓解双优化目标间的梯度冲突；2）设计基于梯度无序度的自适应冻结算法动态确定冻结层；3）使用梯度无序度指标识别训练中的不稳定层。

Result: 在多个有影响力的OOD基准测试上，FQAT在分布内和分布外图像分类任务中都优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: FQAT通过平坦化导向的量化训练策略，有效解决了QAT在OOD数据上的泛化性能下降问题，实现了可泛化的量化感知训练。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集和双表征框架(DRF)，通过结合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量来解决基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查问题，取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI脊柱侧弯筛查方法主要依赖轮廓数据集，忽略了临床相关的姿态不对称性。姿态数据虽然能提供直观的骨骼表示，但由于大规模标注数据集稀缺和原始姿态坐标的离散噪声敏感性，基于姿态的筛查研究不足。

Method: 1) 扩展Scoliosis1K数据集创建Scoliosis1K-Pose，包含447,900帧2D关键点；2) 提出双表征框架(DRF)，整合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量(PAV)；3) 设计PAV引导注意力(PGA)模块，利用PAV作为临床先验指导特征提取。

Result: DRF实现了最先进的性能，可视化证实模型能够利用临床不对称线索指导特征提取，并促进双表征之间的协同作用。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查的关键挑战，数据集和代码已公开，有助于推动该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级token选择框架，通过评估视觉token的激活值并保留最高分token，同时使用语义记忆库和两级排序机制来提升提示调优的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功表明提示调优可以实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关特征组件会引入噪声并增加计算成本，需要一种既能提高准确性又能提升效率的方法。

Method: 提出Spotlighter框架：1）从样本级和语义级评估每个视觉token的激活值，只保留最高分token；2）使用类别特定的语义记忆库学习原型来精化选择；3）引入两级排序机制动态加权token-原型交互。

Result: 在11个few-shot基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升高达11.19%，额外实现0.8K FPS，仅增加21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是提示调优中有效且可扩展的基线方法，在准确性和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

TL;DR: DarkVRAI是一个针对低光照RAW视频去噪的新框架，通过条件化方案和Burst-Order Selective Scan机制，在AIM 2025挑战赛中取得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照RAW视频去噪面临严重信号退化问题，由于高传感器增益和短曝光时间的限制，需要新的方法来提升视频质量。

Method: 提出两个主要贡献：1）将图像去噪的条件化方案成功应用于视频去噪，利用捕获元数据指导对齐和去噪过程；2）引入Burst-Order Selective Scan机制，有效建模噪声视频序列中的长程时间依赖性。

Result: 在严格且真实的基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，为低光照视频去噪设立了新标准。

Conclusion: DarkVRAI通过协同结合条件化方案和BOSS机制，成功解决了低光照RAW视频去噪的挑战性问题。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangDC是一种语言感知的动态令牌压缩器，通过轻量级语言模型生成视频片段的软描述令牌，根据语义密度动态调整压缩比例，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频令牌压缩方法使用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异性，导致信息丰富的片段表示不足，而静态或内容贫乏的片段产生不必要的计算开销。

Method: 使用轻量级语言模型描述视频片段，转换为软描述令牌作为视觉表示，通过语义密度感知监督训练，动态调整压缩比例基于场景丰富度（通过描述长度反映）。

Result: 实验结果显示，与VideoGPT+相比，FLOPs减少49%，同时保持竞争性性能。定性结果表明方法能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整令牌压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC通过语言感知的动态令牌压缩，有效解决了固定压缩比例的问题，模仿人类动态表达视觉内容的方式，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

TL;DR: 研究如何在3D高斯拷贴框架中集成RGB和多谱图像，提出了三种策略并验证关键交换作用，以获得更好的多谱重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然3DGS在RGB数据上表现优异，但在多谱数据上的每谱段优化会导致重建质量差，因为同一地形在不同谱段中出现不一致。

Method: 评估了三种策略：1）单独每谱段重建 2）分段优化（先RGB地形优化，再优化其他谱段） 3）联合优化（多模态同时优化，可选先RGB阶段）。建议将多谱数据直接集成到球面谐波颜色组件中。

Result: 专门优化的联合策略在多谱数据集上通过定量指标和质性新视角渲染显示了有效性，提高了整体谱段重建质量，并通过谱间交调改善RGB结果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了优化过程中什么时候以及如何引入谱段的关键交换作用，为健壮的多模态3DGS重建提供了实用见解。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雨天显著增加道路事故风险，了解驾驶员在恶劣天气下的视觉行为对于设计更强大的驾驶员监控系统(DMS)和高级驾驶辅助系统(ADAS)至关重要。

Method: 采用两步聚类方法：首先在10秒间隔内对注视点进行聚类，然后将聚类中心聚合成元聚类，结合马尔可夫转移矩阵、注视持续时间、视线仰角和方位角分布等指标进行分析。

Result: 雨天条件下驾驶员更频繁地扫视仪表盘，注视持续时间更长，视线仰角更高，表明认知专注度增加，但整体注视行为（关注道路和偶尔检查后视镜）保持一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了恶劣条件下视觉注意力模式的宝贵见解，强调了利用注视建模辅助设计更强大ADAS和DMS的潜力。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Motivation: 现有的滑块式方法通常为每个属性单独训练适配器，忽略了多个属性之间的纠缠问题，导致不同属性之间产生干扰，无法精确控制多个属性。

Method: 提出CompSlider方法，在条件先验空间中生成控制多个属性的条件先验，引入新颖的解耦损失和结构损失来组合多个属性变化，同时保持图像结构一致性。

Result: 方法在多种图像属性上进行了评估，并扩展到视频生成，展示了其通用性。在潜在空间中操作，无需重新训练基础模型，降低了计算负担。

Conclusion: CompSlider能够实现更可靠和独立的属性操作，解决了多属性滑块控制中的纠缠问题，为精确的多属性同时控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖合成数据，少数使用真实数据的方法仅针对雨滴去除。本文关注更复杂的现实场景中玻璃表面的多种污染物清理问题。

Method: 采集真实配对图像数据，提出包含一次性测试时自适应机制的全能模型，利用自监督辅助学习任务针对每个测试图像的独特污染类型更新训练模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理现实世界中玻璃表面的多种污染物，通过测试时自适应机制实现了对未知污染类型的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Conclusion: LPFM作为首个统一的低级别病理学基础模型，成功解决了病理图像增强的多样化挑战，为计算病理学提供了强大的图像质量提升工具。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Motivation: 医学图像异常检测需要高效率和准确性，但现有CNN模型感受野有限，Transformer模型计算成本过高。Mamba架构处理长序列的线性复杂度特性为此提供了新思路。

Method: 提出SpectMamba架构，包含混合空间-频率注意力块(HSFA)分别学习高低频特征，视觉状态空间模块(VSSM)增强长程依赖，以及Hilbert曲线扫描技术优化空间相关性。

Conclusion: SpectMamba成功将Mamba架构应用于医学图像检测，通过频率-空间特征融合和优化扫描策略，在效率和准确性方面都表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了双向稀疏注意力(BSA)框架来解决视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高分辨率长视频时的计算瓶颈问题，通过动态稀疏化查询和键值对来显著提升训练和推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高质量视频时面临二次复杂度的全注意力计算瓶颈，导致训练和推理成本过高，需要解决查询和键值对的冗余计算问题

Method: BSA框架包含两个关键组件：通过语义相似性和动态时空训练策略选择最具信息量的查询令牌来实现查询稀疏化；通过计算统计动态阈值来保留最显著的KV块实现KV稀疏化

Result: BSA在长序列上显著加速DiT训练，FLOPs减少高达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，同时保持甚至超越全注意力的生成质量

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频DiT模型的计算效率问题，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升了训练和推理效率，为高质量视频生成提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

*Zhihong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视频端到端姿态估计模型VEPE，通过三个时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，解决了传统两阶段方法的效率问题，在Posetrack数据集上较传统方法提升300%的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的两阶段视频姿态估计方法将空间和时间维度分离，无法抓取全局时空上下文，且依赖独立检测器和复杂后处理，影响推理效率。

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个核心时空Transformer组件：STPE时空姿态编码器、STDME时空可变形内存编码器、STPD时空姿态解码器。同时提出实例一致性机制来改善跨帧姿态查询匹配。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上表现超过大部分两阶段模型，并将推理效率提升了300%。

Conclusion: VEPE框架通过端到端的时空Transformer设计，有效解决了视频姿态估计中的效率和性能问题，为实时应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PVINet是一个点云压缩网络，通过点-体素交错结构并行提取全局结构特征和局部上下文特征，并在各尺度进行交互，使用条件稀疏卷积实现特征增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云压缩方法通常顺序处理全局和局部信息，缺乏两者之间的有效通信，导致重建质量受限。

Method: 提出点-体素交错网络(PVINet)，包含体素编码器提取全局特征和点编码器建模局部上下文，引入条件稀疏卷积实现特征交互。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，PVINet相比最先进方法具有竞争优势。

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理和特征交互机制有效提升了点云压缩的重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [233] [FICGen: Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement for Layout-driven Degraded Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01107)
*Wenzhuang Wang,Yifan Zhao,Mingcan Ma,Ming Liu,Zhonglin Jiang,Yong Chen,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出FICGen方法，通过频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式，解决退化场景下布局到图像生成中的上下文幻觉困境，显著提升了生成质量和布局对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有布局到图像生成方法在退化场景（如低光、水下）中存在生成保真度有限和与用户提供布局对齐弱的问题，主要归因于退化条件下的"上下文幻觉困境"，即前景实例被上下文主导的频率分布所淹没。

Method: 提出频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式(FICGen)：1) 使用可学习的双查询机制和专用频率重采样器从训练集中提取上下文频率原型；2) 采用视觉频率增强注意力将频率原型注入退化生成过程；3) 开发实例一致性图调节潜在空间解耦；4) 使用自适应空间频率聚合模块重建混合退化表示。

Result: 在5个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FICGen在各种退化场景（从严重低光到轻度模糊）中 consistently超越现有L2I方法，在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FICGen通过将退化图像的频率知识转移到潜在扩散空间，有效解决了退化场景下的上下文幻觉问题，为布局到图像生成在复杂环境下的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

### [234] [GPSToken: Gaussian Parameterized Spatially-adaptive Tokenization for Image Representation and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01109)
*Zhengqiang Zhang,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种新颖的高斯参数化空间自适应图像标记化框架，使用2D高斯分布动态建模不同图像区域的形状、位置和纹理，实现非均匀图像标记化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，无法灵活表示不同形状、纹理和位置的区域，限制了特征表示的有效性。

Method: 首先使用熵驱动算法将图像划分为不同大小的纹理均匀区域，然后将每个区域参数化为2D高斯分布（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征。训练专门的transformer优化高斯参数，实现位置/形状的连续自适应和内容感知特征提取。

Result: 在图像重建和生成任务中，使用128个标记实现了rFID 0.65和FID 1.50的最先进性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过将空间布局与纹理特征解耦，实现了高效的两阶段生成：先使用轻量级网络合成结构布局，再进行结构条件纹理生成。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

*Weiren Zhao,Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Wenjun Liao,Sichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSSL是一个通用的半监督学习框架，通过空间异质损失函数为不同像素分配不同权重，利用参考预测和监督预测之间的不确定性和一致性信息，显著提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，但忽视了标注数据中的潜在噪声以及不同未标注像素的异质性价值。作者认为有效挖掘两个预测中的丰富信息比特定参考预测策略更重要。

Method: 提出基于空间异质损失的通用框架MetaSSL，将未标注数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），使用自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测，并为不同区域分配递减的权重。该损失也应用于标注图像以考虑潜在标注噪声。

Result: 实验结果表明，当与现有SSL框架集成时，MetaSSL在不同数据集上显著提高了分割性能。

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一个即插即用的通用框架，能够有效挖掘预测中的丰富信息，通过空间异质损失处理标注噪声和像素异质性，显著提升半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

TL;DR: 提出MVTrajecter方法，利用多时间戳轨迹信息进行多视角行人跟踪，通过轨迹运动成本和外观成本实现更鲁棒的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端MVPT方法仅依赖当前和单个相邻过去时间戳，忽略了更早的轨迹信息，导致关联性能受限。

Method: 引入轨迹运动成本和轨迹外观成本，基于注意力机制捕捉多时间戳关系，即使某个时间戳出现错误关联也能通过其他时间戳纠正。

Result: 大量实验证明各组件有效性，性能超越之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MVTrajecter通过利用多时间戳轨迹信息显著提升了多视角行人跟踪的关联鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现流行的视觉编码器在识别视频关键帧方面存在局限，无法准确找到MLLM应该关注的信息帧，需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型依赖视觉语言编码器进行关键帧采样，但不确定这些编码器是否能真正识别出最具信息量的帧。

Method: 通过实证研究分析流行视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面的能力限制。

Result: 发现当前视觉编码器在识别MLLM应该关注的关键帧方面存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术来提升视频MLLM的效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

TL;DR: DynaMind是一个从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的新框架，通过联合建模神经动力学和语义特征，显著提升了视频重建的准确性和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景时面临空间分辨率低、时间不匹配和语义信息利用不足的问题，导致动态连贯性和复杂语义上下文解析不充分。

Method: 提出DynaMind框架，包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列确保时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)在语义先验指导下将时序蓝图转换为高保真视频。

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上达到新的SOTA性能，视频和帧级准确率分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%，显示出卓越的视觉保真度和时间连贯性。

Conclusion: 该研究在神经动力学与高保真视觉语义之间的鸿沟上取得了关键进展，为脑解码领域提供了重要的技术突破。

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Motivation: 解决多主体个性化图像生成中主体保真度保持和跨主体属性泄漏的问题，实现无需测试时优化的多主体精细控制。

Method: 基于动态语义对应和参考图像复杂度自适应识别焦点区域，在训练过程中跨噪声时间步渐进调整焦点区域，采用加权策略奖励信息丰富区域并惩罚低置信度区域。

Conclusion: FocusDPO有效缓解属性泄漏问题，在多样化生成场景中保持优异的主体保真度，推动了可控多主体图像合成的前沿发展。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了鲁棒且可迁移的解决方案，在遥感图像分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Motivation: 解决森林监测中基于多时相观测预测树木生长的深度学习模型训练数据缺乏的问题，填补森林监测能力的关键空白。

Method: 提出编码器-解码器框架，利用多时相多光谱影像和相对时间差异来预测树冠高度。使用U-Net架构在PrediTree数据集上进行训练。

Result: U-Net架构在PrediTree数据集上获得11.78%的掩码均方误差，比次优的ResNet-50架构提升约12%，比仅使用RGB波段的实验减少约30%误差。

Conclusion: PrediTree数据集和提出的框架为树木生长预测提供了有效的解决方案，数据集已在HuggingFace公开，代码在GitHub开源。

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This

Motivation: 解决跨多个3D形状建立点对点对应关系的基本问题，现有方法主要从单一形状学习规范嵌入，无法充分利用整个形状集合的流形结构。

Method: 使用形状图注意力网络捕捉整个形状集合的底层流形结构，构建共享潜在空间；通过宇宙预测器实现形状到宇宙的一致对应；在空间和谱域双重表示对应关系，并通过新颖的循环一致性损失强制对齐。

Conclusion: DcMatch通过利用形状集合的整体结构和双重一致性约束，实现了更准确和一致的非刚性多形状匹配，为计算机视觉和图形学中的对应关系建立提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Motivation: 当前肿瘤空间异质性分析方法在连续切片中存在空间错位问题，严重影响病理学原位解释的准确性，需要更精确的虚拟染色模式。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）原型驱动的染色模式转移与显式内容-风格解耦；2）循环注册-合成框架GapBridge通过可变形结构对齐桥接H&E和IHC域；3）变形感知对抗学习，生成器和变形感知注册网络联合对抗优化风格聚焦判别器。

Conclusion: 该工作为虚拟染色提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算病理学领域的发展。

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Motivation: 高质量标签数据对文档转换模型至关重要，但手动标注成本高、自动标注准确性低，传统汇编学习方法在实际应用中表现有限

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段通过合成数据生成大规模多样化数据，经过训练获得基础模型；第二阶段采用自成改进方法，用模型标注真实文档后通过筛选策略验证标注质量，并迭代重新训练模型

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决复杂格式文档的标注问题，通过全自动化流程构建高质量数据集和高性能模型，为文档提取领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Method: 开发了点云视图生成的裁剪机制，提出新颖的位置编码来表示两个解耦视图之间的3D相对位置，通过交叉重建范式从一个视图重建另一个视图

Result: 在ScanObjectNN的三个变体上，使用Mlp-Linear评估协议，比自重建基线(Point-MAE)分别提升了6.5%、7.0%和6.7%

Conclusion: 双视图交叉重建相比自重建显著增加了预训练难度，使该方法在3D自监督学习中超越了之前的单模态自重建方法

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个端到端框架，联合处理激光雷达超分辨率和语义分割，通过轻量化模型实现与高分辨率64通道激光雷达相当的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率激光雷达成本昂贵限制了大规模部署，而低成本传感器（如16通道激光DAR）产生的稀疏点云会降低分割精度，需要解决这一矛盾。

Method: 采用联合优化训练框架，SR模块融入语义线索并保留细节；提出新的SR损失函数聚焦感兴趣区域；设计轻量级模型架构，参数少且易于与分割网络兼容。

Result: 实验表明该方法在语义分割性能上达到了与昂贵64通道高分辨率激光雷达相当的效果。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架成功解决了低成本传感器性能受限的问题，为自动驾驶大规模部署提供了经济有效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGRD是一种基于扩散模型的医学图像分割框架，通过学习体素级分布来捕捉分割不确定性，通过先验引导和残差学习提高校准性和采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中存在模糊性，需要模型捕捉完整的条件分布而非单点估计，现有方法在校准性和采样效率方面存在不足。

Method: 将离散标签嵌入连续空间对齐分割与扩散建模；使用粗粒度先验预测器提供步进指导；扩散网络学习相对于先验的残差；采用深度扩散监督方案稳定训练。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，PGRD相比贝叶斯、集成、Probabilistic U-Net和普通扩散基线方法，获得了更高的Dice分数和更低的NLL/ECE值，且需要更少的采样步骤。

Conclusion: PGRD框架能够有效学习医学图像分割的体素级分布，在保持强校准性的同时提高了采样效率，为不确定性分割提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial
environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised
deep learning. We perform an analysis of these methods, using a newly de-
veloped dataset comprising over 10k images and 120k in- stances. By evaluating
their performance, accuracy, and com- putational efficiency, we identify the
most reliable detection systems and highlight the specific challenges they
address in industrial applications. This paper also examines the use of deep
learning models to improve image quality in noisy industrial environments. We
introduce a lightweight model based on a fully connected convolutional network.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的街道级图像地理定位方法，通过结合多模态大语言模型和检索增强生成技术，在不需细调或重新训练的情况下实现了狭领先的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体数据和智能手机摄像头的普及，传统计算机视觉技术在图像定位方面遇到挑战，需要更有效的解决方案来支持导航、位置基础推荐和城市规划等关键应用。

Method: 方法通过SigLIP编码器在两个大规模数据集(EMP-16和OSV-5M)上构建向量数据库，使用检索增强生成技术从数据库中检索相似和不相似的地理位置信息来增强查询图像，然后通过多模态大语言模型进行处理。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了检索增强生成基于多模态大语言模型在地理定位估计中的有效性，为传统从头开始训练模型的方法提供了替代方案，为GeoAI领域开启了更易访问和可扩展解决方案的新可能性。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Conclusion: AgroSense为精准农业提供了实用、可扩展的实时决策支持解决方案，为资源受限环境中的轻量级多模态AI系统开辟了道路。

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

*Che Liu,Zheng Jiang,Chengyu Fang,Heng Guo,Yan-Jie Zhou,Jiaqi Qu,Le Lu,Minfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3Ret是一个统一的医学图像检索模型，通过自监督学习在混合模态数据集上训练，无需模态特定定制，在零样本检索中超越现有基准，并能泛化到未见过的MRI模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法针对不同模态使用分离的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定的设计限制了可扩展性和统一表示的发展，需要开发能够处理多种医学成像数据的统一模型。

Method: 构建包含867,653个医学成像样本的大规模混合模态数据集，包括2D X光、超声、RGB内窥镜视频和3D CT扫描。使用生成式(MAE)和对比式(SimDINO)自监督学习范式训练统一的视觉编码器M3Ret，无需任何模态特定定制。

Result: M3Ret在所有单个模态的零样本图像检索中达到新的最先进水平，超越了DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等强基线。在没有配对数据的情况下实现了强跨模态对齐，并且能够泛化到未见过的MRI任务，尽管预训练期间从未见过MRI数据。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了纯视觉自监督学习对未见模态的泛化能力，为医学成像社区提供了有前景的方向，将M3Ret定位为多模态医学图像理解中视觉自监督学习基础模型的重要一步。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Method: 提出三部分框架：面部感知提示增强（GPT-4o）、提示感知参考图像增强（ID保持图像生成器）和ID感知时空指导增强（统一梯度优化）

Result: 在ACM Multimedia 2025挑战赛中获得第一名，在1000个视频测试集上通过自动和人工评估验证，展现出领先的性能和强大的通用性

Conclusion: TPIGE框架为身份保持视频生成提供了一种高效、低成本的新方案，充分利用了提示工程和生成指导来提升输入质量和视频质量

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了可转向摄像头带来的动态场景分析挑战，为实时边缘视频分析提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: RAL框架通过概率建模和置信门控机制，解决了部分相关视频检索中的数据不确定性问题，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分相关视频检索面临查询歧义性和视频部分相关性带来的数据不确定性挑战，现有方法容易受到虚假语义关联的干扰。

Method: 提出RAL框架：1) 将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模；2) 引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度；3) 作为即插即用方案集成到现有架构中。

Result: 在多种检索骨干网络上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: RAL框架通过显式建模数据不确定性，有效解决了PRVR中的跨模态对齐问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: RibPull是一种利用隐式占用场连接计算几何和医学成像的方法，通过神经占用场表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取中轴，相比体素网格能更好地处理稀疏数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体素网格在医学成像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，需要更有效的3D表示方法来处理稀疏噪声数据。

Method: 使用神经占用场预测3D点是否在物体内部来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩来提取胸腔的中轴线。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，证明了连续坐标基3D场景表示相比体素基表示的优越性。

Conclusion: 隐式3D表示方法能够更有效地处理稀疏噪声数据，保持复杂的几何信息，并支持进一步的形态学操作，为医学成像提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法主要关注语义控制，往往忽视了保持风格一致性的关键任务，这影响了图像的整体美感和连贯性。

Method: 提出Neural Scene Designer框架，采用并行交叉注意力机制分别处理文本和风格信息，并设计渐进式自风格表示学习模块通过风格对比损失来学习细粒度风格表示。

Result: 在建立的综合基准测试上进行的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性，能够实现照片级真实的区域操作，同时保持语义对齐和风格一致性。

Conclusion: NSD框架成功解决了图像编辑中的风格一致性问题，通过创新的并行处理机制和风格学习模块，为图像编辑任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

<details>

Motivation: 为了解决传统图像质量评估方法需要大规模人工标注数据的问题，同时开发一个既可作为质量度量又可作为感知优化工具的多功能解决方案

Method: 使用伪MOS监督训练，通过应用可重现的失真并使用考虑视觉掩蔽效应的现代质量度量集合进行评分。在潜在空间优化中结合空间掩蔽和课程学习策略

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中超越现有度量标准，推理速度快，在去噪、超分辨率和人脸修复等任务中显著提升性能，同时减少计算开销

Conclusion: MILO不仅是最先进的图像质量度量标准，还是生成管道中感知优化的实用工具，在图像和潜在空间都表现出色

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Result: 该方法即插即用，大量实验证明了在可变尺度图像生成中的有效性。

Conclusion: InfoScale通过信息中心化的方法有效解决了扩散模型在可变尺度图像生成中的关键问题，为多尺度图像生成提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent

find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

TL;DR: PointSlice是一种新颖的点云处理方法，通过将3D点云水平切片成多个2D数据批次，结合切片交互网络(SIN)保持垂直关系，在保持高精度的同时显著提升推理速度和减少参数数量。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上比SAFDNet快1.13倍，参数减少0.79倍，精度仅下降1.2 mAPH；在nuScenes数据集达到66.74 mAP的SOTA结果；在Argoverse 2数据集快1.10倍，参数减少0.66倍，精度下降1.0 mAP。

Conclusion: PointSlice成功实现了高速推理与高精度的平衡，为3D点云目标检测提供了有效的解决方案，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的3D形状生成建立了一个实用框架，实现了高几何保真度的快速生成。

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了自适应卷积模块来解决nnUNet框架中内部超参数自动调整的不足，通过动态调整卷积核大小来提升模型泛化能力，在MSA2-Net中实现了优异的医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: nnUNet框架虽然能自动调整训练脚本中的大多数超参数，但忽略了分割网络内部超参数的调优，这限制了模型的泛化能力。需要一种能够根据不同数据集特征动态调整网络参数的方法。

Method: 提出了自适应卷积模块，可根据不同数据集的独特特征动态调整卷积核大小。该模块集成到MSA2-Net的两个关键组件中：多尺度卷积桥和多尺度融合解码器，分别用于精炼CSWin Transformer的输出和捕获不同大小器官的细节信息。

Result: MSA2-Net在四个医学图像分割数据集上表现出色：Synapse (86.49%)、ACDC (92.56%)、Kvasir (93.37%)、ISIC2017 (92.98%)的Dice系数，证明了其鲁棒性和精确性。

Conclusion: 自适应卷积模块有效解决了nnUNet的内部超参数调整局限，MSA2-Net架构在多种医学图像分割任务中展现出卓越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Conclusion: V²Drop提供了一种有效的token压缩解决方案，解决了现有方法的位置偏差和兼容性问题，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the

TL;DR: HIFU-ILDiff是一种基于潜在扩散模型的深度学习新方法，能够实时抑制HIFU治疗中超声图像的干扰，显著优于传统陷波滤波器方法，实现15帧/秒的实时处理。

Motivation: HIFU治疗的成功和安全性依赖于实时监测，但使用超声引导HIFU治疗时经常受到干扰的阻碍，需要开发有效的干扰抑制方法。

Method: 采用Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)将噪声超声图像编码到低维潜在空间，然后通过潜在扩散模型迭代去除干扰，最后解码重建高分辨率无干扰超声图像。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪HIFU干扰，为HIFU治疗提供实时监测能力，将大大提高当前临床应用中的治疗精度。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感数据集缺乏时序图像对和详细文本标注，单时相图像无法捕捉灾害动态影响，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建大规模基准数据集RSCC，涵盖地震、洪水、野火等多种灾害类型，提供人类级别的变化描述文本。

Result: RSCC数据集能够支持详细的灾害相关分析，为遥感领域的视觉语言应用提供更准确、可解释和可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: RSCC数据集通过弥合遥感数据中的时序和语义鸿沟，为灾害感知的双时相理解提供了强有力的支持，推动了遥感视觉语言应用的发展。

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets
lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While
single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture
dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the
Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,
interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理视频内容时面临空间分辨率和时间覆盖之间的权衡问题，视频理解仍是一个具有挑战性的领域。

Method: 采用三种关键技术：1）基于帧间相似度的慢快视频编码策略；2）从8K到128K token的渐进式四阶段预训练；3）包含思维链数据构建、GSPO强化学习和对齐训练的综合后训练流程。

Conclusion: 该模型通过创新的编码策略、渐进式训练方法和综合后训练技术，成功解决了视频理解中的关键挑战，为多模态视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

TL;DR: RocketScience是一个开源的对比视觉语言模型基准测试，专门测试空间关系理解能力，包含全新的真实世界图像-文本对，主要覆盖相对空间理解和物体顺序。该基准对人类来说很简单，但对当前VLM模型来说很困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间关系理解方面存在明显不足，需要专门的基准来测试和评估模型的空间推理能力，以推动该领域的发展。

Method: 创建全新的真实世界图像-文本对数据集，设计专门测试相对空间理解和物体顺序的任务，进行解耦分析以分离物体定位和空间推理能力的贡献。

Result: 结果显示开源和前沿商业VLM模型在空间关系理解方面表现显著不足，而推理模型表现意外地好。性能瓶颈主要在于空间推理能力而非物体定位能力。

Conclusion: RocketScience基准揭示了当前VLM模型在空间关系理解方面的严重缺陷，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考，数据集以CC-BY-4.0许可证开源发布。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

TL;DR: ViSTA-SLAM是一个无需相机内参的实时单目视觉SLAM系统，采用轻量级对称双视图关联模型作为前端，后端使用专门的Sim(3)位姿图处理闭环，在相机跟踪和3D重建质量方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个无需相机内参的通用视觉SLAM系统，使其能够适用于各种不同的相机设置，同时保持轻量级和高性能。

Method: 前端使用轻量级对称双视图关联(STA)模型，仅从两张RGB图像同时估计相对相机位姿和回归局部点云图；后端构建专门的Sim(3)位姿图，包含闭环检测来处理累积漂移。

Result: 前端模型大小仅为同类最先进方法的35%，显著降低了模型复杂度；在相机跟踪和密集3D重建质量方面实现了优于当前方法的性能。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM系统通过创新的轻量级前端设计和专门的后端优化，成功实现了无需相机内参的高性能实时单目视觉SLAM，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中需要针对不同编辑任务使用不同的控制信号，导致模型设计复杂且需要大量训练资源。

Method: 提出O-DisCo-Edit框架，包含基于随机和自适应噪声的对象扭曲控制信号(O-DisCo)，以及用于保护未编辑区域的"复制形式"保护模块。

Result: 大量实验和人工评估表明，O-DisCo-Edit在各种视频编辑任务中超越了专业和多任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个统一的解决方案，能够灵活封装多种编辑线索，实现高效高保真的视频编辑。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的编码器-解码器视觉Transformer模型，用于同时从两个角度分割导管并进行3D力估计，在合成X射线图像上优于现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务深度学习模型通过CNN编码器-解码器处理导管插入手术中的触觉和视觉感知，但需要逐步扩展感受野。本文从新视角出发，旨在利用Transformer捕获长距离依赖关系。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer模型，将两个输入X射线图像作为独立序列处理。编码器和解码器生成的嵌入分别输入两个共享分割头，回归头使用解码器融合信息进行3D力估计。

Result: 在具有不同噪声水平的合成X射线图像上进行广泛实验，相比最先进的分割模型、基于视觉的导管力估计方法以及多任务方法，性能均更优。

Conclusion: 提出的立体视觉Transformer模型在导管分割和力估计两方面都达到了新的最先进水平，为导管插入手术提供了更准确的感知能力。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

TL;DR: 提出Panel-of-Peers学习框架，通过多个LVLM模型的同伴评估和迭代自我改进来避免依赖人工标注偏好数据的成本和质量问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖人工精选的偏好数据，成本高；机器生成的偏好数据质量有限；自监督偏好数据容易引入幻觉

Method: 受人类协作学习启发，构建一组LVLM模型组成的小组，通过迭代自我改进过程进行产出生成、评估和精炼，模拟同伴评审系统

Result: 在十五个测试集上平均分数从48%提升到57%，显著改善模型性能，无需大量人工标注数据

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers学习框架作为一种可扩展的自监督对齐替代方案具有强大潜力，能够有效提升模型性能而不依赖人工标注数据

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确率，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高昂，few-step模型虽然减少了去噪步骤但仍依赖大型未压缩的骨干网络，限制了后训练量化方法的应用。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过修改扩散模型调度器来调整few-step采样轨迹；引入JAQ损失函数，结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标进行细粒度优化，无需全精度推理校准。

Result: 相比FP16 4步潜在一致性模型提升15.5% FID，相比FP16 8步分阶段一致性模型提升16.6% FID；大规模用户研究（80,000+标注）证实了在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上的有效性。

Conclusion: 量化与few-step蒸馏在高保真生成中是互补的，Q-Sched为高效扩散模型推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

TL;DR: OpenVision 2通过移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式标题损失，显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性，同时保持竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升OpenVision架构的训练效率，减少训练时间和内存消耗，同时保持多模态性能。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用生成式标题损失进行纯生成式训练。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍（83h→57h），内存使用减少1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批大小从2k增至8k，参数规模超过10亿，性能与原模型相当。

Conclusion: 轻量级纯生成式范式对未来多模态基础模型中视觉编码器的发展具有重要价值。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Conclusion: GaussianGAN通过创新的高斯泼溅和分割技术，实现了实时照片级人体化身渲染，在像素保真度和视觉质量方面达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

Motivation: 多光谱图像数据维度高且处理复杂，多标签分类进一步增加了特征提取的难度，需要研究降维方法的有效性

Method: 使用ResNet50和DINOv2架构，在分类器前加入可选的PCA步骤将数据降维至3维，然后输入三层分类器进行多标签分类

Result: PCA的有效性强烈依赖于所选的深度学习架构和训练策略，不同架构对PCA的响应不同

Conclusion: 研究为自监督预训练和替代降维方法的未来研究开辟了道路，需要根据具体架构选择是否使用PCA

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Motivation: 岩石粒度精确分类对岩土工程、采矿和资源管理至关重要，影响运营效率和安全性。现有方法需要更好的细粒度分类能力来处理岩石图像的自然纹理特征。

Method: 在ConvNeXt架构基础上，引入自注意力机制捕捉长距离空间依赖关系，加入通道注意力机制强调信息丰富的特征通道，形成混合设计模型CNSCA。

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于临床元数据的两阶段扩散框架，用于有限角度CT重建，通过元数据引导生成解剖先验并整合物理约束，显著提升重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT虽然能提高时间分辨率和降低辐射剂量，但存在严重的伪影问题。传统方法忽略了丰富的临床元数据信息，导致重建质量受限

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段使用基于Transformer的扩散模型，仅依赖元数据（采集参数、患者人口统计、诊断印象）从噪声生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段整合粗略先验和元数据生成高保真结果。每个采样步骤都使用ADMM模块强制执行基于物理的数据一致性

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，整合元数据显著提高了重建保真度，特别是在严重角度截断情况下。在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上优于现有无元数据基线方法

Conclusion: 临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面具有双重作用，不同类型的元数据提供互补优势，支持将其整合到未来的元数据引导医学成像框架中

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Conclusion: TransMatch代表了增材制造缺陷检测领域的重大进步，为广泛工业应用中的质量保证和可靠性提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect
data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images,
TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视觉识别数据通常呈现长尾分布，给深度神经网络的高效训练和部署带来挑战。传统信息瓶颈方法在处理长尾数据时效果有限，需要新的解决方案

Method: 1. 平衡信息瓶颈(BIB)：将损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术集成到原始信息瓶颈网络中；2. 多重平衡信息瓶颈(MBIB)：混合多个BIB结构，不同BIB负责结合来自不同网络层的知识，实现端到端学习

Conclusion: 所提出的BIB和MBIB方法能够学习到充分且保留重要标签相关信息的表示，有效解决了长尾视觉识别问题，从信息论角度同时训练表示和分类

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照控制方法需要大量领域特定数据集训练，限制了基础模型的泛化能力和适用性。需要一种更实用的方法，能够利用现有生成模型的基础知识来实现光照控制。

Method: 基于光照关系与自注意力层中token交互相似的洞察，训练轻量级LoRA回归器生成直接辐照度图，然后使用分类器引导将期望光照整合到图像生成过程中。

Result: 在多种场景类型上实现了最先进的性能表现，在质量和控制方面都表现出色，相比领先工作具有更好的参数和数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过挖掘基础模型的知识，图像光照控制是可行的，该方法实现了实用且通用的重光照功能，为图像光照编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

TL;DR: LGDiST是首个无参考的潜在基因扩散模型，用于处理空间转录组学数据丢失问题，在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，并提升6种最先进方法的基因表达预测性能达10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于计算机视觉的空间转录组学分析方法存在数据丢失问题，现有方法依赖单细胞RNA测序参考，容易受到对齐质量、外部数据集、批次效应和继承性数据丢失的影响。

Method: 提出LGDiST模型，使用之前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富且有生物学意义的遗传潜在空间，采用扩散模型架构，包含上下文基因、ST潜在空间和邻居条件等关键组件。

Result: 在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，在6种最先进方法上基因表达预测性能提升达10%。移除关键组件会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构比任何单独组件都能获得显著更好的性能，证明了该方法在空间转录组学数据补全方面的有效性。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Conclusion: 该研究为CAV中联邦学习物体检测的实际部署提供了关键见解，解决了数据异构性、硬件约束和环境变化等挑战，推动了稳健联邦学习系统在自动驾驶领域的应用。

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一种可立即部署、灵活且可解释的工作流程，避免了监督训练的需求，显著加快了灾后应急响应中的分流和优先级分配。未来可以继续探索LLM提示在损失评估中的潜力。

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Conclusion: 这是首个将可解释性引入地理定位的工作，通过概念瓶颈方法同时提升了模型性能和解释能力，为地理决策过程提供了更深层次的语义理解

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Conclusion: 为将高斯泼溅技术应用于2D图像处理开辟了新的方向，证明了其在图像修复任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个针对多主体个性化生成的表示中心框架，通过显式语义对应和正交特征解耦来解决身份混合和属性泄漏问题，在4+参考主体情况下仍保持高保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多主体个性化生成在合成多个参考主体的图像时面临身份保真度和语义连贯性的挑战，现有方法由于对主体在共享表示空间中如何交互的建模不足，容易出现身份混合和属性泄漏问题

Method: 提出MOSAIC框架，包含：1）SemAlign-MS数据集提供细粒度语义对应；2）语义对应注意力损失确保精确点对点语义对齐；3）多参考解耦损失将不同主体推入正交注意力子空间

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，现有方法通常在3个以上主体时性能下降，而MOSAIC在4+参考主体情况下仍保持高保真度

Conclusion: MOSAIC通过精确的语义对齐和特征解耦，为复杂多主体合成应用开辟了新可能性，解决了多主体生成中的关键挑战

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

TL;DR: VARIN是首个为视觉自回归模型设计的基于噪声反转的编辑技术，通过位置感知Argmax反演生成逆Gumbel噪声，实现精确图像重建和文本引导的针对性编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然条件生成已被广泛探索，但无需额外训练即可进行提示引导图像编辑的能力同样重要，因为它支持众多实际应用。

Method: 引入Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN)，利用新颖的位置感知Argmax反演(LAI)伪逆函数生成逆Gumbel噪声，实现源图像精确重建和可控编辑。

Result: 大量实验表明VARIN能有效根据指定提示修改源图像，同时显著保留原始背景和结构细节。

Conclusion: VARIN被验证为一种实用的编辑方法，为视觉自回归模型提供了有效的文本到图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Draw-In-Mind (DIM)数据集和统一模型，通过将设计责任明确分配给理解模块，显著提升了图像编辑性能，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态统一模型在文本到图像生成方面表现良好，但在精确图像编辑方面存在困难，主要原因是理解模块和生成模块之间的责任分配不平衡。

Method: 构建包含14M图像-文本对的DIM-T2I和233K思维链想象的DIM-Edit数据集；通过轻量级两层MLP连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B模型；在DIM数据集上训练得到DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit模型。

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性性能，超越了UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit等更大模型。

Conclusion: 将设计责任明确分配给理解模块能够为图像编辑带来显著好处，证明了责任平衡分配的重要性。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter是一种新颖的方法，用于在文本到图像扩散模型中基于用户指定的调色板进行条件生成。该方法通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，并引入两个标量控制参数来灵活控制调色板遵循程度和颜色变化，同时使用负直方图机制抑制不需要的色调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板是创意工作流程中广泛使用的紧凑直观工具，但在用于图像生成条件时存在显著的模糊性和不稳定性。现有方法难以在保持调色板遵循度和图像质量之间取得良好平衡。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个控制参数；使用负直方图机制抑制不需要的色调；在精心策划的数据集上训练以确保颜色空间的广泛泛化。

Result: 通过定性、定量评估和用户研究表明，该方法在实现强调色板遵循度和高图像质量方面 consistently优于现有方法，能够稳定地生成语义连贯的图像。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter提供了一种有效的方法来解决调色板条件图像生成中的模糊性和不稳定性问题，通过创新的控制机制实现了灵活的颜色控制和高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源环境中早产儿监测的挑战，现有手动观察或侵入式传感器存在错误多、不实用和可能造成皮肤损伤等问题。

Method: 设计了一种嵌入式监测系统，使用量化的MobileNet模型在Raspberry Pi上进行实时行为状态检测，集成了模型量化、Raspberry Pi优化视觉管线和安全IoT通信等三项关键创新。

Result: 系统在公开新生儿图像数据集上达到了状态自然准确率（睡眠检测91.8%，哭叹/正常分类97.7%），模型大小减少68%，适合实时边缘部署。

Conclusion: 轻量级优化模型如MobileNet是建立可扩展、低成本且临床可行的NICU监测系统的最可行基础，为改善资源突出环境中的早产儿护理推广了道路。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言-视觉理解方面取得进展，但其可靠性和鲁棒性研究不足。本文从设计逻辑角度分析RMOT系统的安全影响，识别对抗性漏洞。

Method: 提出VEIL对抗框架，针对RMOT系统的语言-视觉参考和目标匹配组件进行攻击，特别针对使用FIFO内存的先进RMOT模型，通过时空推理引入持续错误。

Result: 在Refer-KITTI数据集上的综合评估验证了VEIL的有效性，能够破坏跟踪逻辑可靠性，导致轨迹ID切换和终止。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RMOT系统存在严重安全漏洞，强调了在关键大规模应用中需要安全感知的RMOT设计的紧迫性。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Motivation: 现有对比自监督学习方法虽然成功，但依赖大量真实数据和精心策划的困难负样本。本文旨在探索替代方案，通过"伪造"数据来降低这些要求。

Method: 研究两种"伪造"方式：1) 使用生成模型产生合成数据增强样本多样性；2) 在表示空间中生成合成困难负样本。结合这两种方法形成Syn2Co框架，在DeiT-S和Swin-T架构上进行评估。

Result: 研究发现合成数据在自监督学习中具有潜力和局限性，为未来工作提供了见解。

Conclusion: 合成增强训练可以产生更鲁棒和可迁移的视觉表示，但合成数据的使用仍存在限制，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的slot attention方法，通过ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch解决了现有方法缺乏高级语义信息和编码器调整灵活性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有slot attention方法存在两个主要问题：(1)缺乏高级语义信息，仅依赖低级特征如颜色和紋理；(2)无法细调编码器，限制了灵活性。

Method: 提出ContextFusion阶段利用前景和背景的语义信息，以及Bootstrap Branch来解耦特征适应和重建阶段，支持灵活的编码器调整。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上，方法显著提升了多个SOTA slot attention模型的性能。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了slot attention的两大限制，提供了更丰富的语义信息和更灵活的编码器调整能力。

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

TL;DR: SALAD是一种语义感知的判别式逻辑异常检测方法，通过引入组合分支显式建模对象组合图的分布，在MVTec LOCO基准上达到96.1%的图像级AUROC，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构性异常（如凹痕、划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测方面表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新设计的组合分支来显式建模对象组合图的分布，学习重要语义关系。同时引入无需手工标签或类别特定信息的新型组合图提取流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上，SALAD显著优于最先进方法，实现了96.1%的令人印象深刻的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组合图分布，SALAD在逻辑异常检测方面取得了显著改进，为语义感知的异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Conclusion: NOOUGAT是首个能够处理任意时间跨度的跟踪器，统一了在线和离线跟踪范式，为实际部署提供了灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够有效生成适用于PAR任务的合成行人图像，通过精心设计的参数优化可以显著提升模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Conclusion: 建立了全景场景理解的新基准，为下游应用如具身AI、自动驾驶和沉浸式环境提供了重要工具

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于轨迹的新型数据集ITD，用于测试时间适应方法的基准测试，该数据集模拟真实世界中的时间依赖性挑战，并通过对抗性内存初始化策略提升了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTA基准测试主要关注分布偏移和i.i.d.假设违反，但未能真实反映现实场景中自然存在的时间依赖性（如视频流中连续帧显示同一对象）。需要创建能够体现这种时间依赖性的基准数据集。

Method: 从目标跟踪数据集的边界框中收集目标中心图像序列（轨迹），构建ITD数据集。提出对抗性内存初始化策略来改进基于内存的TTA方法。

Result: ITD数据集成功模拟了真实世界的时间依赖性挑战。对抗性内存初始化策略显著提升了多种方法在这个具有挑战性的基准上的性能。

Conclusion: ITD数据集填补了当前TTA基准测试的空白，为评估时间依赖性场景下的方法性能提供了重要工具。提出的对抗性内存初始化策略有效改进了现有TTA方法在处理时间依赖性挑战时的表现。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人群计数模型在处理复杂人群场景时面临两个主要挑战：区域间密度分布差异大，以及视角变化和姿态差异导致的个体表示不一致，限制了计数精度

Method: 提出DSGC-Net双流图卷积网络，包含密度近似(DA)分支和表示近似(RA)分支。DA分支构建密度驱动的语义图，RA分支构建表示驱动的语义图，分别应用图卷积网络建模潜在语义关系

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过双流图卷积网络有效捕捉密度变化和表示分布中的潜在特征相关性，提升了模型对密度变化的适应能力，在多视角和多姿态场景中提高了计数精度

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is
available at: https://github.com/Wu-eon/CrowdCounting-DSGCNet.

Motivation: 遥感应用中的分布外检测面临数据稀缺、复杂多尺度场景结构和显著分布偏移等挑战，现有方法和基准测试不适合遥感图像。

Method: 采用遥感特定的视觉语言建模，包含空间特征增强、双提示对齐机制（交叉验证场景上下文与细粒度语义的空间语义一致性）和置信度引导自训练循环（动态挖掘伪标签扩展训练数据）。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中持续优于现有方法，能够以最少标注数据实现高效适配。

Conclusion: 空间语义整合具有关键价值，RS-OOD框架为遥感OOD检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在空间推理任务上表现不佳，如物体位置关系判断。现有方法通过模型微调或手工设计的损失函数进行优化，但这些方法不够理想

Method: 训练轻量级分类器从扩散模型的交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，然后将该分类器作为学习到的损失函数在推理时使用。采用双重反转策略避免分类器走捷径学习语言痕迹而非真实空间模式

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev上空间准确率从0.20提升到0.61，在SD2.1上从0.07提升到0.54，能够泛化到多种空间关系并显著提升准确率

Conclusion: Learn-to-Steer框架通过数据驱动的目标学习有效解决了扩散模型的空间推理问题，相比手工设计损失函数的方法有显著优势

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出ORDAC方法，通过标签分布学习自适应校正序数分类中的噪声标签，在年龄估计和疾病严重程度检测任务上显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序数图像分类中标签边界模糊，标注过程容易产生噪声标签，这会显著降低机器学习模型的性能和可靠性

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)建模序数标签的模糊性和不确定性，在训练过程中动态调整每个样本标签分布的均值和标准差，校正而非丢弃噪声样本

Result: 在Adience数据集上，40%噪声情况下ORDAC_R将平均绝对误差从0.86降至0.62，召回率从0.37提升至0.49，在原始数据集的内在噪声校正中也表现有效

Conclusion: 使用标签分布进行自适应标签校正是提升序数分类模型在噪声数据下鲁棒性和准确性的有效策略

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面的局限性，提出了MulSeT基准测试，发现仅增加训练数据无法有效提升空间理解能力，且空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器而非语言模型的位置编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面仍存在困难，但缺乏全面系统的评估。本文旨在从数据和架构两个角度系统分析MLLMs在单视图、多视图和视频三种场景下的空间理解能力。

Method: 提出MulSeT基准测试，设计一系列实验分析MLLMs的空间推理能力。从数据角度分析训练数据量对性能的影响，从架构角度分析位置编码在视觉编码器和语言模型中的作用。

Result: 空间理解性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，上限较低，特别是需要空间想象的任务。空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码，而非语言模型中的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以实现满意的空间理解性能，需要通过架构设计优化空间理解能力，为改进空间推理能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedDINOv3是一个将DINOv3视觉基础模型适配到医学图像分割的框架，通过多尺度token聚合架构和领域自适应预训练，在多个分割基准测试中达到或超越最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学CT和MRI扫描中器官和肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型缺乏跨模态和跨机构的泛化能力。视觉基础模型虽然提供强大可迁移表示，但在医学图像分割中仍面临ViT骨干网络性能不足和自然图像与医学图像领域差异大的挑战。

Method: 首先重新设计简单有效的多尺度token聚合架构，然后在包含387万张轴向CT切片的CT-3M数据集上进行多阶段DINOv3领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征。

Result: MedDINOv3在四个分割基准测试中匹配或超越了最先进的性能，证明了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干网络的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过适当的架构设计和领域自适应预训练，视觉基础模型可以成功适配到医学图像分割任务，为构建通用医学图像分析模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高性能实时立体匹配方法依赖对移动设备不友好的3D正则化，而基于2D正则化的方法在病态区域表现不佳，需要开发部署友好的解决方案。

Method: 首先分析4D成本体积的解耦特性，设计轻量级双向几何聚合块分别捕获空间和视差表示，通过解耦学习实现实时性能。

Result: 实验表明DBStereo在推理时间和准确度上都优于所有现有基于聚合的方法，甚至超过迭代方法IGEV-Stereo。

Conclusion: 该研究打破了使用3D卷积处理4D成本体积的经验设计，为解耦聚合范式提供了简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割依赖大规模高质量标注，但专家标注存在主观性和粗糙标注等噪声问题，影响模型性能

Method: 几何距离感知模块动态调整像素级权重，结构引导标签精炼模块利用结构先验优化标签，知识转移模块增强监督和对局部细节的敏感性

Result: 在6个公开数据集上验证，在Kvasir提升2.52%，Shenzhen提升22.76%，BU-SUC提升8.87%，BraTS2020提升4.59%

Conclusion: GSD-Net能有效处理医学图像分割中的标注噪声问题，显著提升模型在噪声环境下的性能表现

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

Motivation: 红外和可见光图像融合在增强场景感知方面至关重要，但目前轻量级模型实现高质量融合仍面临挑战，需要新的方法来提升学生模型的性能。

Method: 采用强化学习驱动的协作蒸馏框架，智能体根据学生表现和师生差距生成挑战性样本供学生自学习，并动态调整教师指导强度以优化知识传递。

Conclusion: 该框架通过强化学习智能体指导的协作蒸馏和自学习机制，有效解决了轻量级模型高质量图像融合的挑战，为多模态图像融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

TL;DR: 一种新的实时虚拟化妆尝试框架，通过分离化妆提取和渲染实现高保真度的妆容转移，同时保持身份识别和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚拟化妆方法存在身份偏移、公平性问题，且缺乏实时能力和时间一致性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将化妆转移解耦为两步：透明化妆面具提取和图形化渲染，使用伪真实数据训练模型，采用图形渲染和无监督k-means聚类方法生成训练数据，添加专门的训练目标如alpha权重重建和唇彩损失。

Result: 方法在多样化的姿势、表情和肤色上实现了稳健的化妆转移，保持了时间平滑性，在细节捕捉、时间稳定性和身份完整性方面超过现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了实时虚拟化妆尝试中的高保真度、身份保持和时间一致性挑战，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Motivation: 传统低分辨率卫星数据难以准确监测狭窄或泥沙含量高的河流，限制了精细尺度的水文建模和水资源管理。

Method: 通过计算机科学与水文学专家合作，手动标注1145张高分辨率图像，并与多源卫星数据（Sentinel-2、SWOT、SWORD）配准，评估不同传感器的成本-精度权衡。

Result: 建立了首个全球高分辨率河流宽度估算基准，中位误差7.2米，显著优于现有卫星方法；评估了多种深度学习架构和预训练策略。

Conclusion: RiverScope为精细尺度和多传感器水文建模提供了宝贵资源，支持气候适应和可持续水资源管理，最佳模型结合了迁移学习和多光谱通道的优势。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Conclusion: 提出的生成式视频合成方法能够自动化传统视频制作流程，为用户提供灵活的动态元素定制能力，显著提高了视频合成的效率和质量。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了各向异性傀里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，一种能够处理医学形态学图像各向异性特征的位置编码方法，在多个医学图像分析任务中显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像通常具有各向异性特征，而传统的正弦位置编码(SPE)和同象性傀里叶特征位置编码(IFPE)无法有效处理这种异性问题，需要专门的位置编码方法来满足医学图像分析的特殊需求。

Method: 提出了各向异性傀里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，该方法是IFPE的一种普遍化，能够结合各向异性、类别特定和领域特定的空间依赖关系。在胸部X光片多标签分类、CT图像器官分类和心辅图弹射分数回归任务中进行了系统性测试。

Result: 结果显示选择合适的位置编码可以显著提高模型性能。AFPE在所有测试的各向异性场景中都显著超过了现有的最优位置编码方法。最优PE的选择取决于目标结构的形状和数据的各向异性程度。

Conclusion: 在处理各向异性医学图像和视频时，选择适合数据特征和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要。AFPE为这一问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

Motivation: 现有的多目标发现方法虽然利用目标中心学习和运动线索，但仍需要监督来生成伪标签训练模型。本文旨在开发一个完全无监督的方法来解决这一限制。

Method: 扩展自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR，通过检索无相机运动的视频帧进行无监督光流运动分割来生成高质量伪标签，然后使用这些伪标签精炼槽表示并训练槽停用模块来区分前景和背景。

Result: 在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上取得了强大的多目标发现结果，性能优于之前的state-of-the-art方法，尽管是完全无监督的。

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR证明了概念简单但有效的完全无监督多目标发现方法的可行性，通过运动精炼策略显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

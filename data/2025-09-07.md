Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较了多种大语言模型适应策略在痴呆症检测中的应用，发现适当的模型适应策略（包括演示选择、推理设计和调优方法）对基于语音的痴呆症检测至关重要，且经过适当调整的开源模型可以匹配或超越商业系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国超过一半的阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症患者未被诊断，基于语音的筛查提供了一种可扩展的检测方法。需要评估不同的大语言模型适应策略在痴呆症检测中的效果。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音语料库，评估了9个纯文本模型和3个多模态音频-文本模型。适应策略包括：不同演示选择策略的上下文学习、推理增强提示、参数高效微调以及多模态集成。

Result: 类中心演示获得最高的上下文学习性能，推理改进了较小模型，标记级微调通常产生最佳分数。添加分类头显著改善了表现不佳的模型。多模态模型表现良好但未超越顶级纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适应策略（包括演示选择、推理设计和调优方法）对基于语音的痴呆症检测具有关键影响，经过适当调整的开源模型可以匹配或超越商业系统。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA)框架，通过自合成数据和强化学习来提升语音大语言模型在指令跟随任务中的性能，超越了传统蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)由于模态差异，在指令跟随任务中相比文本大语言模型存在显著性能差距，特别是在处理动态多变的用户语音时。

Method: 使用强大的教师LLM通过自合成方法生成大量高质量对齐数据，然后采用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，避免了对人工标注的依赖。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，超越了传统蒸馏基线，并在口语问答和语音转文本翻译等任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RBA框架能够仅使用自生成数据就显著提升SpeechLMs的性能，证明了其在多模态语言模型对齐中的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

### [3] [Multilevel Analysis of Cryptocurrency News using RAG Approach with Fine-Tuned Mistral Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03527)
*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用细调的Mistral 7B模型通过多层次多任务分析加密货币新闻，生成图谱和文本摘要并通过RAG技术提高准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在加密货币新闻分析中的幻觉问题，通过知识图表示和多层次分析提供更全面的视角

Method: 使用4-bit量化和PEFT/LoRA方法细调Mistral 7B模型，结合RAG技术，进行多层次的图谱和文本摘要生成，并通过层次堆叠生成综合报告

Result: 细调后的Mistral 7B模型能够进行信息丰富的定性和定量分析，提供重要见解，知识图表示有效减少了模型幻觉

Conclusion: 多层次多任务的图谱-文本摘要结合方法为加密货币新闻分析提供了有效的解决方案，具有良好的应用前景

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

### [4] [The ProLiFIC dataset: Leveraging LLMs to Unveil the Italian Lawmaking Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03528)
*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC是一个基于意大利立法过程的事件日志数据集，使用LLM从非结构化数据构建，旨在推动法律领域的过程挖掘研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在工业领域应用广泛，但在法律领域受限于数据可获取性和质量，需要高质量的法律过程数据集来推动相关研究

Method: 从Normattiva门户网站获取非结构化数据，使用大语言模型(LLMs)进行结构化处理，构建1987-2022年意大利立法过程的综合事件日志

Result: 成功创建了ProLiFIC数据集，展示了初步分析示例，为法律过程挖掘提供了基准数据集

Conclusion: ProLiFIC数据集填补了法律过程挖掘领域的数据空白，促进了过程挖掘与LLMs的结合，为法律PM研究提供了新的发展机会

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态框架，通过层次话语树编码营收会议，结合文本、音频、视频情感信号和结构元数据，生成语义丰富的嵌入表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态情感分析系统大多依赖平面的文档级或句子级模型，无法捐描营收会议这类半结构化金融沟通的层次化话语结构。

Method: 提出两阶段变换器架构：第一阶段通过对比学习在节点级利用多模态内容和话语元数据进行编码，第二阶段合成整个会议的全局嵌入表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的嵌入表示形成了稳定、语义丰富的表示，能够反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该系统除了金融报告外，还可通用于其他高风险即兴沟通领域，如远程医疗、教育和政治话语，提供了一种健壮且可解释的多模态话语表示方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [6] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于转换器模型的Early-SIB方法，通过分析青少年在论坛上的发帖和互动，在其明确表达自杀念头前预测自杀意念和行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因缺乏心理健康服务接触而被漏检。社交媒体提供了实时分析青少年在线表达的机会

Method: 提出Early-SIB转换器模型，序列处理用户在论坛的发帖和互动内容，预测其是否会写出自杀意念和行为相关帖子

Result: 在荷兰青年论坛数据集上达到0.73的平衡准确率，能够在用户明确表达自杀意念前进行预测

Conclusion: 该方法为自杀预测领域提供了新的视角，在不依赖自我曝露信息的情况下实现预测，可作为传统方法的有力补充

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [7] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种使用线性探针训练的实体级幻觉检测方法，可在长文本生成中进行实时检测，性能超过现有基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法要么限于短事实查询，要么需要程度外部验证，在高风险应用中实用性不足

Method: 通过网络搜索标注模型响应中的实体级幻觉，使用线性探针训练有效的幻觉分类器

Result: 在四个模型家族中持续超过基线方法（Llama-3.3-70B AUC 0.90 vs 0.71），而且能够消化到数学推理任务

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的实际幻觉检测提供了有前景的新方向，并公开释放数据集以便重用

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出UDIB方法，通过信息瓶颈原理改进语义分歧检测，用计算高效的上界替代KL散度，为LLM幻觉检测提供更敏感的工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于几何聚类优化空间邻近性，而非下游信息理论分析，存在脱节问题

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)开发原则性主题识别方法，用计算高效上界替代难处理的KL散度项，创建UDIB算法

Result: UDIB可解释为熵正则化和鲁棒化的K-means，能生成最大化提示-响应关系信息量的共享主题表示

Conclusion: UDIB为SDM框架提供更优基础，为检测LLM幻觉提供了新颖且更敏感的工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AR²框架，通过对抗性强化学习增强大语言模型的抽象推理能力，使用教师模型将核心问题转化为复杂叙述，学生模型学习提取底层计算模式，显著提升模型在未见编程任务上的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成方法主要关注表面模式识别，忽视了抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象是计算机科学中的基础技能，对提升LLM泛化能力至关重要

Method: AR²框架：教师模型将内核问题转化为叙述丰富的挑战性描述（不改变基本逻辑），学生编码模型训练解决这些复杂叙述问题并提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在先前未见、具有挑战性的编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架通过显式训练抽象推理能力有效提升了模型性能

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

### [11] [Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03540)
*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过动态构建知识图来提升LLM的事实性回答能力，结合内部知识提取和外部检索，在多个QA数据集上实现了更高的准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在产生事实一致答案时的局限性，传统RAG方法将知识作为非结构化文本处理，限制了组合推理和事实不一致性检测的能力

Method: 提出一种动态构建和扩展知识图的框架，先通过提示从问题中提取种子KG，然后使用LLM的潜在知识迭代扩展，最后通过外部检索选择性精炼图谱，提高事实覆盖并纠正错误

Result: 在三个多样化事实QA测试集上评估，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面都实现了持续改进，超越了基线提示方法和静态KG增强方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是一个有前景的方向，能够以结构化、可解释和可扩展的方式提升LLM的事实性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse框架有效解决了多文档科学推理任务，提供了结构化的研究发展可视化，并发布了相应的基准数据集。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

*Aryan Gupta,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR是一个专为边缘设备优化的OCR系统，在资源受限环境下表现出色，相比大型视觉语言模型在效率和成本方面具有显著优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声和多样化真实世界图像中的OCR挑战，特别是在资源受限的边缘部署环境中，比较传统OCR系统与大型视觉语言模型的性能差异

Method: 构建了Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，并在包含54种语言的双重人工标注数据集上对5种最先进的LVLM和2种传统OCR系统进行大规模比较评估

Result: Qwen获得最高精度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度快35倍(平均每图0.17秒)，成本仅为LVLM的0.01(每1000张图0.006美元)

Conclusion: 在边缘部署场景中，传统OCR系统由于低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍然是最优选择，即使在LLM时代也是如此

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现LLM作为自动评估器存在自我偏好偏差问题，提出使用轻量级导向向量在推理时缓解该偏差，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自我偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自己的输出而非其他模型的输出，这影响了评估管道的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 构建区分合理与不合理自我偏好的数据集，使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建导向向量，在推理时进行干预。

Result: 导向向量能将不合理自我偏好偏差减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法。

Conclusion: 导向向量在缓解不合理自我偏好方面效果显著，但在合理自我偏好和无偏同意方面表现不稳定，表明自我偏好涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更稳健的干预方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

### [16] [Semantic Analysis of SNOMED CT Concept Co-occurrences in Clinical Documentation using MIMIC-IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03662)
*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了SNOMED CT概念共现模式与语义嵌入相似性之间的关系，发现两者弱相关但互补，嵌入能捕捉临床有意义的关联并有助于完善临床标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记的非结构化格式给大规模分析带来挑战，标准化术语如SNOMED CT提高了互操作性，但概念间通过共现和语义相似性的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，使用标准化点互信息(NPMI)和预训练嵌入(ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)，分析概念共现模式与语义相似性的关系，并研究这些关系如何随时间跨专业演变。

Result: 共现与语义相似性弱相关，但嵌入能捕捉文档频率未反映的临床有意义的关联；基于嵌入的建议常匹配后续记录的概念；概念嵌入聚类产生了连贯的临床主题；共现模式与死亡率和再入院等结局相关。

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义嵌入在提高文档完整性、发现潜在临床关系以及为决策支持和表型应用提供信息方面具有互补价值。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨目标和跨领域立场检测中的领域适应问题，传统方法在新目标领域表现不佳，需要能够有效利用新领域样本的方法

Method: 采用度量学习和三元组损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异，构建判别性嵌入空间，使模型能够从新目标领域获取有用样本

Result: 在多个跨目标和跨域场景下，在两个数据集上评估显示，MLSD方法在六个广泛使用的立场检测模型上都取得了统计显著的性能提升

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨域立场检测的性能，为少样本学习在立场检测领域的应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SiLVERScore，一种基于语义感知嵌入的手语生成评估指标，直接在联合嵌入空间中评估手语生成，避免了传统回译评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手语生成评估采用回译方法（生成的手语先识别回文本，再用文本指标比较），这种方法存在两个问题：1）无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（面部表情、空间语法、韵律）；2）难以区分评估错误是来自生成模型还是翻译系统。

Method: 提出SiLVERScore指标，在联合嵌入空间中进行语义感知评估。该方法能够：1）识别现有指标的局限性；2）引入语义感知评估；3）展示对语义和韵律变化的鲁棒性；4）探索跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore在正确和随机对之间实现了近乎完美的区分（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率 < 7%），显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore提供了一种更直接、更准确的手语生成评估方法，能够更好地捕捉手语的多模态特性，避免了传统回译评估的模糊性问题。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标的评估框架，用于系统评估大型视觉语言模型在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现现有模型与人类在基础过程中存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的VLM评测标准主要在单轮或问答场景中进行，而真实世界中的基础过程是一个逐步形成共享理解的交互过程，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出四个指标（基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应性、人类相似度）来系统评估VLM在交互式基础中的表现，在150个自我对战游戏会话中测试三款商业VLM并与人类对比。

Result: 三款模型在至少3个指标上都与人类模式存在差异，GPT4o-mini综合表现最接近人类。发现任务成功并不能表示成功基础，高图像-语句对齐度也不能预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该评估框架和发现为未来VLM基础能力研究提供了重要的研究基础，强调了需要更全面的评测方法来评估模型的真实基础能力。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

TL;DR: 提出了Align-then-Slide框架，用于评估超长文档级机器翻译，通过自动对齐和滑动窗口评估解决传统句子级评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型带来了文档级机器翻译的新时代，但其整文档输出挑战了现有的基于句子对齐的评估方法，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 包含两个阶段：Align阶段自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系并重建目标文本；n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate阶段计算1-4个chunk的平均指标分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关系数达到0.929，在新构建的真实测试集上也与人工判断高度一致，且能有效支持CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为文档级机器翻译系统提供了准确、鲁棒且可操作的评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

TL;DR: 提出NE-PADD方法，通过命名实体识别和注意力机制改进部分音频深度伪造检测，在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上表现优于现有基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子级音频深度伪造检测无法定位伪造片段，而现有部分音频伪造检测方法未充分利用音频中的语义信息特别是命名实体

Method: 使用并行分支结构：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD检测，采用注意力融合和注意力转移两种注意力聚合机制，通过辅助损失指导PADD学习命名实体语义

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 集成命名实体知识能有效提升部分音频深度伪造检测性能

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了"Drivelology"语言现象，它是一种语法结构正确但语用偏称的"有深度的踪话"，当前的大语言模型在理解这类文本时显示出显著的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者发现虽然大语言模型在许多NLP任务上表现优异，但在理解具有深层语义的Drivelology文本时却一赖失败，这揭示了模型语用理解的深层表征缺口。

Method: 研究构建了一个包否超1,200个精心编辑示例的多语言数据集，包括英语、普通话、西班牙语、法语、日语和韩语，并通过多轮专家评审确保质量。对多个LLM进行了分类、生成和推理任务的评估。

Result: 模型常常将Drivelology与浅层踪话混淆，产生不连贯的解释，或完全错过隐含的调辞功能。这些结果显示了LLM在语用理解方面的清晰局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLM在语用理解方面的深层表征缺口，并挑战了统计流畅度就等同于认知理解的假设。研究释放了数据集和代码以便进一步研穫浅层语言一致性之外的语言深度建模。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT推理技术提升了LLM在语言理解、复杂问题解决和代码生成等任务的表现，但对其如何影响语言模型可信度的全面理解仍然不足。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，按时间顺序系统梳理了推理模型和CoT技术的最新研究，重点分析五个可信推理维度的研究方法、发现和局限性。

Result: 研究发现推理技术通过减少幻觉、检测有害内容和提高鲁棒性来增强模型可信度，但最先进的推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私性方面存在可比甚至更大的漏洞。

Conclusion: 本文为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的宝贵资源，指出了未来研究方向，强调了在推进推理技术的同时需要关注其安全风险。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令引发安全问题，现有研究使用探测方法来检测恶意输入，但作者发现这些方法在分布外性能表现不佳，怀疑其学习的是表面模式而非语义有害性

Method: 通过控制实验系统研究：首先比较简单n-gram方法的性能，然后使用语义清理的数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性

Result: 确认了假设：探测方法学习的是指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而非语义有害性。简单n-gram方法可以达到类似性能，表明当前探测方法的局限性

Conclusion: 当前基于探测的安全检测方法存在虚假安全感，需要重新设计模型和评估协议，为负责任的研究方向提供建议

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

TL;DR: MobileRAG是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的移动代理框架，通过InterRAG、LocalRAG和MemRAG三个组件解决现有移动代理的三大问题：过度依赖LLM理解能力、缺乏外部环境交互、缺少记忆能力，在复杂移动任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的移动代理存在三个主要问题：1)过度依赖LLM的理解能力，容易产生误操作或遗漏步骤；2)缺乏与外部环境的交互，当应用无法满足查询时任务会终止；3)缺乏记忆能力，每次指令都需要重新构建界面且无法从错误中学习。

Method: 提出MobileRAG框架，包含三个RAG组件：InterRAG用于交互增强，LocalRAG用于本地知识检索，MemRAG用于记忆增强。利用RAG技术更快速准确地识别用户查询并完成复杂长序列移动任务。

Result: 在MobileRAG-Eval基准测试中，MobileRAG相比最先进方法提升了10.3%的性能，且使用更少的操作步骤就能轻松处理真实世界的移动任务。

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG增强有效解决了现有移动代理的局限性，在复杂移动任务处理方面表现出色，为移动智能代理的发展提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Result: 在四个广泛使用数据集上性能超过最先进方法，理解时间仅为基准方法的14.4%

Conclusion: MoT框架通过多维度思维和知识纠正，实现了高效准确的复杂QA解决方案

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

TL;DR: KPoEM是一个用于现代韩语诗歌情感分析的新数据集，包含7,662个标注条目，44种细粒度情感类别，基于该数据集微调的模型在情感分类任务上表现显著优于通用语料训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在文本情感分类方面取得了显著进展，但诗歌特别是韩语诗歌由于其比喻性语言和文化特殊性，在计算情感分析领域仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含7,662个条目的多标签情感数据集（7,007行级条目和615作品级条目），标注了44种细粒度情感类别。采用顺序微调策略，先在通用语料上预训练，再在KPoEM数据集上微调。

Result: 基于KPoEM数据集微调的韩语模型显著优于先前模型，F1-micro得分达到0.60，而通用语料训练的模型仅为0.34。模型能够有效识别时间和文化特定的情感表达，并保持现代韩语诗歌的核心情感。

Conclusion: 该研究连接了计算方法和文学分析，通过结构化数据为诗歌情感的定量探索提供了新可能性，忠实地保留了韩国文学的情感和文化细微差别。

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在RAG场景中虽然能提升任务特定性能，但会导致灾难性遗忘，使模型失去原有知识和通用能力。现有解决方案要么需要通用指令数据，要么在保持模型原始分布方面存在局限。

Method: 提出SelfAug自分布对齐方法，通过将输入序列logits与模型语义分布对齐来缓解灾难性遗忘。该方法不需要通用指令数据，能够有效保持模型的原始分布特性。

Result: 大量实验表明，SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间实现了优越的平衡。实证分析揭示了分布偏移与RAG场景中灾难性遗忘严重程度之间的直接相关性。

Conclusion: SelfAug不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。该方法在保持模型原有能力的同时显著提升了特定任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证式迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自博弈微调(SPIN)在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性，无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用验证式迭代微调，基于数据库模式和验证反馈迭代合成高质量微调数据；2）自博弈阶段引入错误驱动损失机制，激励对手模型的错误输出，使主模型能区分正确和错误SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个常用基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL方法有效解决了Text-to-SQL任务中自博弈微调的挑战，通过创新的验证迭代和错误驱动机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Weihao Wu,Liang Cao,Xinyu Wu,Zhiwei Lin,Rui Niu,Jingbei Li,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoxRole是首个专门用于评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理的综合性基准，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，涵盖1228个独特角色，解决了该领域缺乏标准化评估基准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究存在两个主要局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征（语调、韵律、节奏等）；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有语音对话数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用大语言模型系统地为每个角色构建多维配置文件，从而创建包含13335个多轮对话的VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 基于VoxRole基准对当代语音对话模型进行了多维评估，揭示了这些模型在保持角色一致性方面的各自优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演领域的关键空白，为评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理提供了首个综合性基准，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

*Ruiling Guo,Xinwei Yang,Chen Huang,Tong Zhang,Yong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CANDY是一个评估大语言模型在中文虚假信息事实核查方面能力的基准测试，包含约2万个标注实例，发现当前LLMs在生成准确核查结论方面存在局限，但作为辅助工具具有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在事实核查中的应用日益增多，但其在核查虚假信息方面的有效性仍不确定，需要系统评估其能力和局限性。

Method: 构建CANDY基准测试，包含约2万个精心标注的中文虚假信息实例，使用思维链推理和少样本提示等技术增强LLMs，并开发分类法分析错误解释。

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面表现有限，即使使用增强技术，事实捏造是最常见的失败模式。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs单独用于事实核查不可靠，但作为辅助工具在增强人类表现方面具有显著潜力。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在极低资源语言上效果差，特别是像Ladin这样的残存语言，缺乏高质量标注数据限制了NLP技术发展。

Method: 利用少量并行拉丁语-意大利语句子对，通过翻译单语意大利语数据生成合成数据集，并采用严格过滤和反向翻译程序确保语言质量。

Result: 将合成数据集整合到机器翻译训练中，在意大利语-Ladin翻译任务上实现了显著攻洞现有基线模型的攻洞。

Conclusion: 为Ladin语言创建了首批公开的NLP数据集，为这种令人关注不够的语言提供了基础资源，支持更广泛的NLP研究和下游应用。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTQA是一个无需训练的TKGQA框架，通过递归分解问题、自底向上求解和多路径答案聚合来提升时序知识图谱问答性能，在复杂查询上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TKGQA方法主要关注隐式时序约束，缺乏处理复杂时序查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播问题。

Method: RTQA包含三个核心组件：时序问题分解器将问题递归分解为子问题，递归求解器使用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解，答案聚合器通过多路径聚合提高容错性。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上实现了显著的Hits@1提升，优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: RTQA通过递归思维和无需训练的方法有效解决了TKGQA中的复杂时序查询处理问题，展示了强大的推理能力和容错性。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在基准测试的改写问题上表现显著下降，虽然模型排名相对稳定，但绝对性能分数下降明显，表明基准测试评估可能无法充分反映模型在实际应用中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在真实世界应用中面对语言变异性的鲁棒性，检验基准测试评估方法的可靠性。

Method: 系统生成六个常见基准测试中所有问题的多种改写版本，测试34个不同规模和性能的最先进LLM在这些改写问题上的表现变化。

Result: LLM在改写输入上的排名相对稳定，但绝对性能分数显著下降，表明模型在处理语言变异性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 基准测试评估的可靠性受到挑战，需要开发更能反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Motivation: 填补中文文本缺乏基于系统功能语法理论的自动注释系统的空白，促进相关理论的应用和推广。

Method: 使用RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型，在人民日报2014语料库中选取4100句话进行功能语法注释建立数据集，通过细调模型实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 在测试集上达到F1值0.852，显著超过其他对比模型，在识别主语、主动词、补语等核心语法元素方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 这是功能语法与注意力模型的首次结合，为中文功能语法自动分析提供了新方法，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Method: 通过变化语料数量和各词性类别的词汇项目数量，使用回归率、覆盖率和余弦相似性指标评估模型在时间上的表现。

Result: 小型简洁模型表现最佳：10分钟转写语料，兼顾性能和数据效率的最优配置为形容词和连词各5个项目，副词、名词、代词、动词各10个项目。

Conclusion: 研究提供了构建稳定个性化词汇模型的实用见解，考虑了最小数据需求，为会话机器人的词汇对齐策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和话语关系的方法，在三个基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，整合实体和话语关系两种特征显著提高了连贯性模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和话语关系对于连贯性评估具有重要价值，联合建模方法能有效提升模型效果。

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT是一个多智能体框架，用于生成高质量的心理咨询对话数据，通过分解咨询任务到专门化的LLM智能体来提升生成质量，在多个评估维度上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展心理咨询需求的增长，需要高质量、隐私合规的数据来微调开源大语言模型，但此类数据稀缺。

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师响应生成分解为协调的子任务，由专门化的LLM智能体处理，每个智能体模拟关键心理技术。

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询对话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著优于现有方法，平均提升一般咨询技能3.2%、CBT特定技能4.3%，专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的对话。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能有效生成高质量心理咨询数据，微调后的模型性能提升显著，为心理咨询AI应用提供了可靠的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug是一个用于社交媒体事件检测的即插即用双增强框架，通过显式文本增强和隐式特征空间增强来提高数据多样性和模型鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但人工标注成本高且费时，需要解决数据稀缺问题

Method: 结合显式文本增强（使用大语言模型的5种生成策略）和隐式特征空间增强（5种新颖的扰动技术，在结构融合嵌入上操作）

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提高约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提高约15.57%

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效提升了社交媒体事件检测性能，通过双增强策略解决了数据稀缺问题

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse IFEval基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在对抗性指令下的反直觉能力，发现现有模型存在认知惯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在监督微调后往往表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与训练模式相冲突的指令，需要评估这种局限性。

Method: 构建包含1012个中英文问题的数据集，涵盖8种反直觉挑战类型，采用人类参与流程和优化的LLM-as-a-Judge评估框架。

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs在对抗性指令下表现不佳，验证了Inverse IFEval基准的必要性。

Conclusion: 未来对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑非常规情境下的适应性，Inverse IFEval可作为诊断工具和方法开发基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 随着医学研究和发展的进步，医疗建议不断更新，而大语言模型依赖静态训练数据导致其可能提供过时或有害的医疗建议，需要研究这一风险。

Method: 创建了两个新的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖普通生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，涵盖医学共识发生变化的情况），并对8个主流LLM模型在这些数据集上进行评估。

Result: 所有测试模型都存在一致的依赖过时知识的问题，对沉淀的预训练数据和训练策略影响进行了分析。

Conclusion: 论文为开发更加时新、可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，并提出了减少过时知识依赖的未来研究方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO提出了一种音素增强的鲁棒上下文ASR方法，通过对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤来解决领域特定命名实体识别问题，显著提升了中英文ASR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在领域特定命名实体（特别是同音词）识别上表现不佳，上下文ASR方法由于实体多样性有限和将实体作为独立token处理，无法捕捉细粒度音素变化和完整的多token偏置。

Method: PARCO方法整合了音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤四个组件，增强音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索，并在不确定性下减少误报。

Result: 在1000个干扰项下，PARCO在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，在英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER，显著优于基线方法，并在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上表现出稳健增益。

Conclusion: PARCO通过音素增强和对比学习机制有效解决了上下文ASR中的实体识别问题，在多个数据集上证明了其优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性：轻微提示词变化会显著改变偏见测量结果，甚至完全逆转偏见方向，离散选择指标比概率指标更容易放大偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的广泛应用，性别偏见问题日益受到关注。现有评估方法通常使用与自然语言分布不同的任务提示，可能通过显性或隐性信号表明性别偏见相关内容的存在

Method: 在两种提示条件下测试模型：(1)使测试情境显著，(2)使性别相关内容显著。使用四种任务格式评估提示敏感性，同时采用token概率和离散选择两种度量指标

Result: 即使微小的提示变化也会显著改变偏见结果，有时会完全逆转偏见方向。离散选择指标倾向于比概率度量放大偏见

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅凸显了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，还为NLP基准测试和开发社区提出了新难题：良好控制的测试设计在多大程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"性能，这对未来基准测试的生态有效性意味着什么

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前语言模型的时间理解研究主要集中在公历，而许多非公历系统如日本历、希吉来历、希伯来历等仍在活跃使用且反映了文化基础的时间概念，需要评估模型在这些非公历系统上的表现

Method: 创建了四个需要时间知识和时间理解的任务数据集，对一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型进行系统性评估

Result: 发现某些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使日语中心模型也在日本历法运算和多历法一致性维持方面遇到困难

Conclusion: 结果强调了开发更好处理文化特定历法理解的语言模型的重要性

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Motivation: 现有MAE方法局限于原始关节坐标重建，导致计算冗余和语义表示有限

Method: 轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化监督信号，采用约束优化确保特征多样性

Result: 训练速度提升6.2倍，在NTU RGB+D和PKU-MMD数据集上达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测显著提升计算效率和表示质量

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏差集成学习和梯度抑制微调来解决多偏差问题，无需测试时的组标签，并在多个数据集上显著提升最差组准确率和降低偏差放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多种重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别特征等），这些偏差会损害视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。单独处理每个偏差效果有限，因为缓解一个偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧。

Method: 1. 自适应偏差集成学习(ABIL)：为每个属性训练编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器明确识别这些偏差
2. 梯度抑制微调：从主干网络的梯度中修剪偏差方向，得到忽略所有学习到的偏差的紧凑网络
3. 引入Scaled Bias Amplification(SBA)指标来区分模型引起的偏差放大和分布差异

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上验证，提升了最差组准确率，将多属性偏差放大减半，并在SBA指标上创下新低，即使偏差复杂性和分布变化加剧。

Conclusion: GMBM是第一个实用的端到端多偏差解决方案，能够有效处理视觉识别中的多重偏差问题，无需测试时的组标签信息。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心脏左室分割上表现良好，但模型过于繁重和慢速，限制了实时应用。需要找到最有效的组件来构建轻量级模型保持高性能。

Method: 通过缩减研究系统性评估了数据增帽方案、网络架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术对心脏分割性能的影响。

Result: 开发的轻量级U-Net模型（200万参数vs 3300万参数）在CAMUS数据集上达到了与nnU-Net统计学等效的性能（Dice分数左室/肌肉/房间为0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89），同时模型大小减少16倍，速度提高4倍。跨数据集验证也显示了类似的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 简单的技术如affine增帽和深度监督就能提供良好的分割性能，而不需要复杂的模型和增帽策略。这为开发高效、轻量级的实时心脏图像分割模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在2D视觉理解方面取得显著进展，但扩展到3D场景理解仍面临挑战。现有方法主要依赖纯文本监督，无法提供学习稳健3D空间表示所需的几何约束。

Method: 采用双重监督范式，在双编码器架构中设计互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，既将3D几何信息作为输入，又作为明确的学习目标，通过几何一致性来促进空间推理能力的发展。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等数据集上的广泛实验表明，Reg3D带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅仅描述它们，实现了有效的3D理解。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in

Motivation: 现有的图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢，需要更高效的图比较方法

Method: 使用可微分图核作为最终学习节点嵌入的距离函数，将跨图节点级交互推迟到联合嵌入架构的末尾

Result: LayoutGKN在相似性计算方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图匹配方法，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理速度，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种新颖的多模态参数高效适应技术，通过奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅需微调0.04%的参数即可实现领域适应，在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上达到最先进的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型适应方法依赖提示工程或添加额外模块，这会限制适应质量、破坏模型稳定性并损害预训练获得的知识。需要一种更高效的适应方法。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)技术，仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量，实现领域适应而不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上实现了最先进的分类结果，在few-shot设置下在准确性和泛化能力方面均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效的多模态适应方法，能够更好地保持模型的泛化能力，同时实现了可解释性分析。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决边缘设备上部署高精度植物病害识别模型的挑战，突破传统注意力机制在抓取病变细微特征方面的局限性

Method: 1）使用无需训练的DeepMAD算法构建高效网络背骨 2）提出STAM注意力模块，通过可变形卷积(DCNv4)和Gabor滤波器分别处理形状和纹理特征

Result: 在CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型(401K参数、51.1M FLOPs)达到89.00%准确率和88.96% F1分数，显著超过基线模型

Conclusion: 通过基于领域知识的分离式注意力机制，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但现有研究不足，光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特征严重阻碍了准确识别

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma非对称增强(GAE)模块和定位引导分支(LGB)，通过多尺度监督解码器(MSSD)生成更准确的预测

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验证实SLENet优于现有最先进方法，并显示出对更广泛COD任务的高泛化能力

Conclusion: SLENet框架有效解决了水下伪装目标检测的挑战，为海洋生态研究和相关应用提供了有力的技术支撑

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

TL;DR: 提出利用视频帧时间连续性改进扩散模型训练的方法，无需修改架构即可加速收敛2倍以上，提升生成多样性和降低FID


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像扩散模型基于独立采样静态图像训练，这种设计存在信息缺陷，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖有限和泛化能力差

Method: 利用连续视频帧中的时间归纳偏置作为训练策略，无需架构修改即可集成到标准扩散训练流程中

Result: 在HandCo数据集上验证，收敛速度提升2倍以上，训练和验证分布的FID均降低，生成多样性得到改善

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少梯度方差来加速收敛，有效利用时间连续性提升扩散模型性能

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像-文本对齐来解决放射学诊断中的误读、注意力盲区和沟通失败问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学诊断错误（包括误读错误、注意力盲区和沟通失败）在临床实践中仍然普遍存在，这些问题源于局部异常遗漏、全局上下文有限和报告语言变异性。在3D成像中，这些问题更加严重，因为临床医生需要检查数百个切片。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，执行局部和全局图像-文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习。为了解决报告变异性，应用语言模型重写并引入放射学语义匹配库进行语义感知对齐。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面实现了最先进的性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测方面表现良好。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过联合局部疾病检测和整体解释，解决了现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足精确局部检测、全局推理和语义一致自然语言报告的问题，为3D CT分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

Motivation: 现有的CLIP提示学习方法在细粒度数据集上表现有限，需要一种能够捕捉细粒度类别间细微差异的方法

Method: 使用属性解耦模块将视觉特征分解为非个体化属性和个体化属性，然后通过粒度学习模块构建视觉粒度，在两种因果推理策略下进行识别

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，CaPL方法显著优于最先进的提示学习方法，特别是在细粒度数据集上

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL能够学习更具判别性的文本提示，有效提升CLIP在细粒度识别任务中的性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Motivation: 现有深度学习气流漩浪减弱方法需要高容量网络学习同步帧之间粗粒度的激浪动力学，计算和存储效率低。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率，可以根本解决这个瓶颈

Method: 首先提出"事件幸运见解"揭示激浪扭曲与事件流逆时空分布的相关性，然后构建EGTM框架，从噪声激浪事件中提取像素级可靠无激浪指导进行时间幸运融合

Result: 在真实数据集上，方法在恢复质量上超越现有SOTA方法(+0.94 PSNR和+0.08 SSIM)，同时模型尺寸、推理延迟和模型复杂度分别减少了710倍、214倍和224倍

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在气流漩浪减弱任务中引入事件模态具有重大效率优势，为高效激浪减弱提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

Motivation: 现有RGB-事件检测方法在处理低信息区域时计算成本高且性能不佳，需要自适应稀疏化方法来提升效率

Method: 提出事件引导多模态稀疏化(EGMS)策略识别并丢弃低信息区域，以及跨模态聚焦融合(CMFF)模块有效整合互补特征

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上相比现有方法在精度和效率方面都取得了更优性能

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效信息融合，为RGB-事件检测提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is

the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By

Method: 提出时间下一尺度预测(TENS)任务，将时间序列建模分解为空间尺度生成和时间场景预测；设计TensFormer模型灵活管理时间因果关系和空间关系；采用整体姿态聚合策略统一处理占用和自运动序列建模。

Result: 实验表明OccTENS在占用质量和推理时间方面均优于现有最先进方法，实现了高质量的长时期占用生成。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的TENS框架和TensFormer架构，成功解决了占用世界模型生成中的关键挑战，为可控、高效的高保真3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

TL;DR: 通过视觉-语言模型为多视图图像伪标注功能部件，结合密集对比学习方法，提出了一种弱监督学习方案来实现跨类别的密集功能对应关系预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨不同类别对象之间建立密集对应关系对于形状重建和机器人操控至关重要。对象的功能（对其他对象的影响效果）可以指导如何建立对应关系，因为支持特定功能的部件通常具有相似的形状和外观

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型为多视图图像自动生成功能部件的伪标签，然后通过密集对比学习技术将功能和空间知识汇聚到一个新模型中

Result: 在合成和实际数据集上的评估显示，该方法在密集功能对应关系预测任务上超过了现有的自监督图像表征和基于视觉-语言模型的基线方案

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉-语言模型的伪标签生成能力和密集对比学习技术，成功开发了一种有效的弱监督学习方案来解决跨类别密集功能对应关系预测问题，为相关任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型在零样本图像识别中表现出色，但在少样本场景下面临计算密集型离线微调的挑战，容易过拟合

Method: 提出包含两个组件的双注意力机制：Memory Attn-Adapter通过支持样本细化类别嵌入，Local-Global Attn-Adapter通过整合局部和全局特征丰富图像嵌入

Result: 在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于最先进方法，保持高效推理并在不同CLIP骨干网络上具有良好的扩展性

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter框架能够从少量标注样本中实现动态适应，解决了传统提示学习方法的局限性

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

TL;DR: SPECS是一种针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调细节准确性，在保持与人类判断高相关性的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在问题：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，表示相似性指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM指标虽然相关性好但计算成本过高，不适用于模型开发中的迭代评估

Method: 基于CLIP模型进行改进，引入新的目标函数来强调特异性：奖励正确细节同时惩罚错误细节，专门针对长图像描述任务优化

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，能够为图像描述模型开发提供实用的迭代评估方案

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个既高效又与人类判断高度相关的评估指标，解决了长图像描述任务中现有评估方法的局限性，特别适合模型开发过程中的迭代使用

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种绘图学习的多视角视频编码框架(LMVC)，通过利用视图间运动和内容相关性来提高压缩效率，支持随机访问和向后兼容性。


<details>

Motivation: 多视角视频作为体积视频的关键数据源，存储和传输面临巨大数据量挑战。当前深度学习视频编码主要集中在单视角或立体视频，多视角场景研究不足。

Method: 提出了两个核心模块：1)基于特征的视图间运动向量预测方法，利用独立视图运动特征来优化依赖视图编码；2)无视差的视图间上下文预测模块，从解码的独立视图内容特征预测视图间上下文。同时配合相应的视图间权重模型来学习视图间优先信息。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种绘图学习的多视角视频编码方案，通过有效利用视图间相关性显著提高了压缩性能，为多视角视频编码领域提供了重要技术进展。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑优化的框架，通过整体区域建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程精炼方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构的几何和拓扑重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖体素重叠度量，无法保证拓扑正确性和完整性。虽然拓扑感知损失和持久同调约束有潜力，但通常只能局部应用，无法保证全局保持或在推理时纠正几何错误。

Method: 采用整体区域建模策略捕捉完整空间上下文；首次引入拓扑完整性Betti约束，联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；使用持久同调进行课程精炼，从粗到细逐步纠正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上，β₀误差分别从69.00降至3.40和从1.65降至0.30，树长检测率和分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效纠正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Motivation: 肺气胸是一种可能威胎生命的疾病，胸部X光照是首选诊断工具，但小型肺气胸很容易被漏诊，需要自动化诊断工具来支持攻影师

Method: 构建了一个基于U-Net网络配合EfficientNet-B4编码器的深度学习流水线，使用SIIM-ACR数据集进行训练，采用数据增庚和二元交叉瑣加Dice损失函数的组合损失

Result: 在独立的PTX-498数据集上，模型达到了0.7008的IoU（交并比聚合）和0.8241的Dice分数，显示出良好的分割性能

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应负文本空间(ANTS)方法，利用多模态大语言模型的理解和推理能力来增强OOD检测，通过生成表达性负标签来精确描述OOD分布，在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95 4.2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假负标签会严重降低近OOD性能

Method: 利用MLLMs识别可能为OOD样本的图像并生成表达性负句子，针对近OOD场景生成视觉相似的负标签，设计自适应加权分数平衡两种负文本空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准上FPR95降低4.2%，达到新的SOTA，方法无需训练且零样本，具有高可扩展性

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过MLLMs的推理能力有效解决了OOD检测中的负空间构建问题，在近OOD和远OOD场景下都表现出色，具有很好的适应性

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法仅依赖图像模态，限制了特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力，特别是在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳

Conclusion: 该方法验证了多模态方法在遥感变化检测中的有效性，代码已开源

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的WSI分类方法在处理空间位置信息和序列长度外推问题上存在不足，且基于Transformer的方法需要定制CUDA内核，部署复杂。需要一种既能有效编码空间关系又易于部署的高效方法。

Method: 提出SAC-MIL方法，包含位置编码模块（使用实例坐标而非索引编码空间关系，处理长度外推问题）和SAC块（基于MLP实现线性时间复杂度的全实例相关性计算）。

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: SAC-MIL通过创新的空间位置编码和高效的MLP-based相关性计算，为WSI分类提供了一种既高性能又易于部署的解决方案，解决了现有方法在空间信息处理和计算效率方面的局限性。

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Method: 提出多任务学习框架，在训练期间利用成对的本地和对比增强MRI数据（有无血管标注的都可以）进行模型训练，通过共享任务结构来提升特征表征能

Result: 辅助数据显著提高了血管分割的准确性，即使在推理时不可用。在标注数据少的情况下效果更为明显，因为共享任务结构有利于特征表征。该方法在脑部脾瘤分割任务中也得到了验证

Conclusion: 即使只在训练期间可用，一种信息丰富的辅助成像模态也能够补充专家标注，为解决医学成像分析中标注数据稀缺问题提供了有效方法

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统研究，模型评估存在不公平性，因为模型通常使用精心挑选的提示词来报告最佳性能。

Method: 提出了Promptception框架，包含61种提示类型，涵盖15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个不同的大型多模态模型在3个多项选择题基准测试上的表现。

Result: 发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型表现更稳定但在复杂提示词上表现较差。提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对不同类型的模型制定专门的提示原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估，专有模型和开源模型在提示词敏感性方面表现出明显差异。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc框架通过创新的垂直切片处理和3D通道注意力机制，有效解决了3D语义占据预测中高度信息处理不足的问题，为自动驾驶的精确3D感知提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新方法来检测视觉Transformer中的偏偏相关，通过大规模ImageNet实验证明了方法的有效性，并发现训练方法对模型依赖偏偏相关有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络视觉模型可能利用数据中的偏偏相关做出正确预测，这种偏偏相关影响模型的可靠性和普适性，需要检测和减缓方法。

Method: 提出了一种新方法来检测视觉Transformer中的偏偏相关，使用了监督学习和自监督学习训练的模型，在ImageNet数据集上进行大规模实验。

Result: 方法能够有效识别偏偏相关，发现相同网络架构下不同训练方法对偏偏相关依赖性有显著影响，识别了ImageNet中存在偏偏信号的类别，并在亲阳性乳腰胸胸块分类中进行了实际应用案例研究。

Conclusion: 研究提供了ImageNet中存在偏偏信号的图片列表，建议在未来研究中谨慎使用这些图片，并强调了检测和减缓偏偏相关对建立可靠机器学习模型的重要性。

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多类多示例学习问题LML，通过多数标签学习来估计每个实例的类别，并设计了计数网络和多数比例增强模块来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在病理图像分割、政治投票预测、客户情感分析和环境监测等应用中，需要从包含多个实例的包中学习，其中包标签是实例的多数类别，但传统多示例学习方法无法有效处理这类问题。

Method: 提出了计数网络来生成包级多数标签，通过统计每个类别的实例数量；开发了多数比例增强模块(MPEM)，通过移除包中的少数类实例来增加多数类比例。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，所提方法优于传统的多示例学习方法，消融研究证实了各个模块的有效性。

Conclusion: LML是一个有价值的新问题，提出的计数网络和MPEM模块能有效解决该问题，特别是在多数类比例较高的包中学习效果更好。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄像头系统在动态场景中响应延迟超过200ms，无法满足复杂场景实时需求，主要由于自动识别算法的深度特征提取能力不足和计算架构效率瓶颈

Method: 硬件采用飞腾FT-2000/4处理器与MLU220加速卡协同计算架构，软件集成轻量化YOLOv5s检测网络与DeepSORT级联跟踪算法，形成"检测-跟踪-反馈"闭环控制链

Result: 系统在1920*1080分辨率视频流处理中实现50-100ms稳定单帧综合处理延迟，多尺度目标识别精度超过98.5%，兼具低延迟和高精度特性

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机监控和国产芯片应用提供了创新解决方案，成功解决了传统系统的响应延迟问题

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于K近邻加权融合的多视角特征重排序方法，无需模型微调或额外标注，显著提升了行人重识别的Rank@1和mAP指标，特别是在MSMT17和Occluded-DukeMTMC数据集上分别提升了9.8%和22.0%。


<details>

Conclusion: 该重排序方法通过多视角特征聚合有效减轻了视角偏差问题，在保持高计算效率的同时显著提升了行人重识别的性能，特别适用于大规模数据集的应用场景。

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Motivation: 现有方法将噪声伪标签作为可靠监督，或让注意力机制将错误传播到所有帧，导致训练过程中错误被放大

Method: 组合双向文本融合(BiT)模块和类别感知时间图(CATS)模块：BiT模块进行语义注入和动态检测，定位和净化清洁语义线索；CATS模块进行语义传播和连接，实现精确的时间语义信息传播

Result: 在LLP和UnAV-100两个标准数据集上多个关键指标达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 结合两种研究方向的优势，通过语义净化和传播机制，有效解决了弱监督下的噪声传播问题

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a
practical and deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/chequanghuy/TriLiteNet.

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset

Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在角色一致性和对话渲染方面存在困难，导致生成伪影和不连贯的叙事。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成逐帧描述、角色细节和对话，采用有界注意力掩码技术控制角色交互，应用身份一致自注意力机制确保跨帧角色一致性，以及区域感知交叉注意力实现精确对象放置。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的注意力机制和后处理技术，有效解决了多角色故事可视化中的一致性和对话分配问题。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of

Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Conclusion: 该自监督框架能够从稀疏视角和无相机位姿监督的图像中有效学习铰接物体的几何、外观和运动学表示

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

TL;DR: 该文章提出了UCF-UM框架，通过周期性评估协议来量化统一视觉语言模型在图像理解和生成任务中的语义漫渐问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法将视觉理解和生成能力分离考虑，无法反映模型在不同模态间循环转换时的语义一致性和模态间表征的结合强度

Method: 设计UCF-UM周期评估协议，交替执行I2T和T2I任务，并提出三个指标：平均累积漫渐(MCD)、语义漫渐率(SDR)、多代生成评估(MGG)，并创建ND400数据集进行验证

Result: 结果显示不同模型在跨模态稳定性上存在显著差异，如BAGEL模型能维持语义一致性，而Vila-u模型尽管单次评测表现优异但漫渐快速

Conclusion: 周期一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评测的必要补充，UCF-UM框架为统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表征强度提供了实用的量化指标

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context

Conclusion: GeoArena为全球图像地理定位任务提供了首个开放评估平台，实现了真正的野外环境和以人为中心的基准测试，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

Conclusion: 编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何预测任务，FE2E框架通过有效的适配策略成功利用了编辑模型的结构先验，在有限数据下实现了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Conclusion: MICACL框架有效解决了动态表情识别中的长尾分布和时空建模问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个将图像美学显著性整合到多模态大语言模型中的框架，专门针对美学图像描述任务，证明了美学显著性特征融合的有效性。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PtyINR框架，通过神经隐式表示同时解决X射线叠层成像中的物体和探针恢复问题，无需预标定探针，在低信号条件下表现出优越的重建质量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线叠层成像在纳米尺度分辨率方面具有优势，但在探针未知时的图像重建存在挑战。传统迭代方法和深度学习在低剂量高速实验的低信号条件下效果不佳，限制了该技术的广泛应用。

Method: 提出Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR)自监督框架，将物体和探针参数化为连续的神经表示，直接从原始衍射图案进行端到端重建，无需探针预标定。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上均实现了优越的重建质量，在挑战性的低信号条件下表现出显著的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用、物理信息驱动的框架，可用于解决探针依赖的逆问题，适用于广泛的计算显微镜问题。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Motivation: 现有的流式3D生成模型需要数十步采样，虽然一致性模型在2D扩散加速方面取得进展，但在更复杂的3D生成任务中仍未被充分探索

Method: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching学习稳定匹配师生速度场，Velocity Distillation利用学习的速度场进行概率密度蒸馏，将优化目标从传输层面转换到速度和分布层面

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变换器的采样步数从25减少到1-2步，在A800上实现0.68s（1步×2）和0.94s（2步×2）延迟，分别获得9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高视觉和几何保真度

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的CM蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步3D生成中实现卓越性能，为3D生成的高效推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络设计和训练策略，实现了高质量的零样本肖像动画属性迁移，为多属性组合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测X光影像中的准直器阻影，虽然应用中最多只有4个边界，但方法本质上不受边界数量限制

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to

visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation

lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

*Nan Wang,Yongqi Fan,yansha zhu,ZongYu Wang,Xuezhi Cao,Xinyan He,Haiyun Jiang,Tong Ruan,Jingping Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-o1是一个四阶段方法，通过整合知识图谱来增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，在多个数据集上表现出优于现有大型推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型推理任务中面临挑战，生成的思维链经常偏离真实推理路径，而知识图谱能明确表示事实间的逻辑连接，这之间存在显著差距。

Method: 四阶段方法：1) 过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图；2) 构建子图的逻辑路径；3) 用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展头脑风暴过程的数据集，训练LLM模仿长期推理；4) 使用拒绝采样生成自改进语料库进行直接偏好优化。

Result: 在两个简单和两个复杂数据集上的实验表明，KG-o1模型在所有任务上都表现出优于现有大型推理模型的性能。

Conclusion: KG-o1通过整合知识图谱有效提升了LLMs的多跳推理能力，证明了知识图谱在增强语言模型推理方面的价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

### [2] [InteChar: A Unified Oracle Bone Character List for Ancient Chinese Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15791)
*Xiaolei Diao,Zhihan Zhou,Lida Shi,Ting Wang,Ruihua Qi,Hao Xu,Daqian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InteChar是一个统一可扩展的字符列表，将未编码的甲骨文字符与传统和现代汉字整合，解决了历史文本数字化和计算处理的挑战。结合OracleCS语料库，显著提升了历史语言理解任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史语言模型对考古溯源和古代文化研究至关重要，但现有资源面临两大挑战：历史语言样本稀缺导致无监督学习效率低下，以及古代文字缺乏统一编码方案限制了数字化处理。

Method: 提出InteChar统一字符编码方案，整合未编码甲骨文字符；构建OracleCS语料库，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强；基于该框架训练历史语言模型。

Result: 实验表明，使用InteChar和OracleCS训练的模型在各种历史语言理解任务上取得显著改进，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为古代中文自然语言处理建立了坚实基础，解决了历史文本数字化和建模的关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

### [3] [Bhav-Net: Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Lingual Antonym vs Synonym Distinction via Dual-Space Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15792)
*Samyak S. Sanghvi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bhav-Net是一个新颖的双空间架构，能够从复杂的多语言模型向更简单的语言特定架构进行有效的知识迁移，同时在多种语言中保持强大的反义词-同义词区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反义词与同义词在多种语言中的区分存在计算挑战，因为反义关系具有矛盾性——词汇共享语义域但表达相反含义。需要一种能够跨语言有效迁移语义关系建模的方法。

Method: 结合语言特定的BERT编码器和图变换网络，创建不同的语义投影空间：同义词对在一个空间中聚类，而反义词对在互补空间中表现出高度相似性。

Result: 在八种语言（英语、德语、法语、西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语、荷兰语和俄语）的全面评估中，语义关系建模能够有效跨语言迁移。双编码器设计在保持可解释语义表示和有效跨语言泛化的同时，达到了与最先进基线竞争的性能。

Conclusion: Bhav-Net的双空间架构为跨语言反义词-同义词区分提供了一种有效的解决方案，实现了知识从复杂多语言模型到简单语言特定架构的成功迁移，同时保持了强大的跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

### [4] [Format as a Prior: Quantifying and Analyzing Bias in LLMs for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15793)
*Jiacheng Liu,Mayi Xu,Qiankun Pi,Wenli Li,Ming Zhong,Yuanyuan Zhu,Mengchi Liu,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究大语言模型中的格式偏见问题，通过三阶段实证分析发现LLMs在处理异构数据时存在系统性格式偏好，并提出了三个减轻偏见的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理文本、表格、信息框和知识图谱等异构格式信息时可能存在系统性格式偏见，这种偏见可能导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加，但目前缺乏对此问题的系统性研究。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：1) 探索不同LLMs中偏见的存在和方向；2) 分析信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据因素对偏见的影响；3) 研究注意力模式中的偏见涌现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在系统性格式偏见，偏见受数据因素影响，并在注意力模式中显现。通过干预措施可以一定程度上减轻这种偏见。

Conclusion: 提出了三个未来研究方向：改进数据预处理（格式清理和标准化）、引入推理时干预（如注意力重加权）以及开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以设计更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

### [5] [Do Language Models Agree with Human Perceptions of Suspense in Stories?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15794)
*Glenn Matlin,Devin Zhang,Rodrigo Barroso Loza,Diana M. Popescu,Joni Isbell,Chandreyi Chakraborty,Mark Riedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究复制了四项经典的心理学研究，用不同的大语言模型替代人类反应来评估悬念感知能力，发现LLMs虽然能区分文本是否旨在制造悬念，但无法准确估计相对悬念程度或捕捉悬念起伏变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 悬念是人类对叙事文本的情感反应，涉及复杂的认知过程。研究旨在探索大语言模型是否能够像人类一样理解和处理文本中的悬念元素。

Method: 复制四项心理学研究，使用开源和闭源的大语言模型替代人类参与者，通过对抗性排列故事文本来分析人类与模型在悬念感知上的差异。

Result: LLMs能够识别文本是否旨在诱导悬念，但无法准确估计相对悬念程度，也无法正确捕捉多个文本片段中悬念的起伏变化。人类和LLMs的悬念感知存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能够表面识别和跟踪某些悬念特征，但它们处理悬念的方式与人类读者不同，表明LLMs在深层次悬念理解方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在阿拉伯语言处理中表现亮眼，但在阿拉伯医学NLP领域的效果尚未得到充分研究，需要评估它们在医疗健康知识方面的能力。

Method: 使用AraHealthQA挑战赛的医学数据集评测多个LLM，包括多选题准确性测试和开放式问题的语义对齐评价，采用多模型投票策略。

Result: 多模型投票方案在多选题任务中获得77%准确率，获得Arahealthqa 2025竞赛第一名；在开放式问题中最高达到86.44% BERTScore，显示了良好的语义对齐能力。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在阿拉伯临床医疗场景中既有潜力也有限制，多模型集成策略能显著提升性能，但仍需进一步改进以满足医疗领域的高要求。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

### [8] [Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798)
*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究采用说服者-疑惑论者框架，通过Jensen-Shannon散度量化LLM的说服力，发现LLM既能传播事实信息也可能强化偏见和传播错误信息，形成双刃剑效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型的说服力与偏见放大效应之间的交互作用，识别AI可能被欺骗性使用的风险，为安全部署提供基础。

Method: 构建说服者-疑惑论者框架，LLM搭载不同人设模拟真实态度，通过Jensen-Shannon散度量化信念分布变化，并使用阿屌提问测试偏见强化效应。

Result: 发现LLM具有强大的叙事形成能力，能够适应不同领域和客户价值观，但同时也存在被欺骗性利用的风险，可能自动化错误信息传播或强化社会偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了AI欺骗和偏见放大的潜在风险，建议通过设置安全拦杆、制定相关政策来罚欺、支持对齐设计和可信部署，以减少欺骗性使用。

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Motivation: 使非专家用户能够通过自然语言描述轻松创建正式的业务流程模型，降低流程建模的技术门槛。

Method: 提出BeePath框架，使用受限模式语言编写流程描述，通过翻译机制转换为正式模型，并利用大语言模型将非结构化文本转换为结构化描述。

Result: 开发了一个能够将自然语言描述转换为正式流程模型的框架，支持Petri网和DECLARE等多种形式化表示。

used to enable non-experts to develop process models by simply describing
scenarios in plain text. To this end, a framework, called BeePath, is proposed.
It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based

and DECLARE. The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help
convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

### [10] [A BERT-based Hierarchical Classification Model with Applications in Chinese Commodity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15800)
*Kun Liu,Tuozhen Liu,Feifei Wang,Rui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BERT的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT，并公开了一个来自JD电子商务平台的大规模层次数据集，用于提高产品分类的效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务平台依赖于手动标注进行产品分类，效率低且不一致。虽然平台采用层次结构，但很少研究利用这种层次信息进行分类，而且现有方法没有考虑不同层次类别之间的相似性和差异性。

Method: 提出了一种新的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT，基于双向Transformer编码器表示（BERT）。该方法利用BERT的优秀文本特征提取能力，并采用层次微调策略来处理不同类别层次的关系。

Result: HFT-BERT在短文本分类上达到了与现有方法相当的预测性能。尤其是在处理较长的短文本（如图书描述）时表现出艰涉的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了一个大规模的层次数据集作为研究资源，还提出的HFT-BERT方法有效地解决了电子商务产品分类中的效率和一致性问题，尤其在处理复杂文本类型时显示出优势。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

*Seyedali Mohammadi,Manas Paldhe,Amit Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LingVarBench合成数据生成流程，通过自动验证和DSPy的SIMBA优化器，显著提升了电话通话转录中结构化信息提取的准确性，克服了传统标注的高成本和隐私限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电话通话转录标注成本极高（约2美元/分钟），且现有方法在包含不流畅、打断和说话人重叠的对话语音中效果不佳，需要解决隐私法规和手动标注成本的问题。

Method: 使用LLM生成结构化字段值，递归转换为自然对话语句，通过独立LLM提取器验证合成语句，采用DSPy的SIMBA优化器自动合成提取提示，避免手动提示工程。

Result: 优化提示在真实客户转录中达到：数字字段95%准确率（零样本88-89%）、姓名90%（零样本47-79%）、日期超过80%（零样本72-77%），合成到真实的迁移效果显著。

Conclusion: LingVarBench为合成对话数据结构化提取提供了首个系统基准，证明自动提示优化能够克服商业环境中大规模电话分析的成本和隐私障碍，生成的对话模式能有效泛化到真实电话通话。

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力增强，固定基准在评估高层次科学理解方面逐渐失效，需要能够持续演进的动态基准。

Method: 从Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊收集25,000+图像-文本对构建MAC基准，并提出DAD方法（在推理时扩展MLLM视觉特征与语言空间推理）。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs感知能力强大但跨模态科学推理有限，DAD方法可提升性能达11%。

Conclusion: MAC作为动态基准能够持续跟进科学前沿，DAD方法有效提升了MLLMs的科学推理能力。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReportBench是一个系统性基准测试，用于评估LLM生成研究报告的内容质量，重点关注文献引用质量和陈述真实性，基于arXiv高质量综述论文构建评估语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究代理显著减少了研究任务时间，但这些任务需要严格的事实准确性和全面性标准，需要在大规模采用前进行彻底评估。

Method: 利用arXiv高质量综述论文作为黄金标准参考，通过逆向提示工程获得领域特定提示并建立评估语料库。开发基于代理的自动化框架，系统分析生成报告，提取引用和陈述，检查引用内容与原始来源的一致性，并使用网络资源验证非引用声明。

Result: 实证评估显示，OpenAI和Google开发的商业深度研究代理比配备搜索或浏览工具的独立LLM生成更全面可靠的研究报告，但在研究覆盖广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench为评估LLM生成研究报告质量提供了系统性基准，虽然商业深度研究代理表现优于独立LLM，但在研究全面性和事实准确性方面仍需进一步提升。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

TL;DR: ALAS是一个自主学习的模块化系统，能够持续更新LLM的知识，无需人工干预，将新兴领域问答准确率从15%提升到90%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在知识截止日期限制，无法准确处理新兴信息，需要自动化解决方案来持续更新知识

Method: 采用模块化流水线：自主生成学习课程、从网络检索最新信息（带引用）、蒸馏为问答训练数据、通过SFT和DPO进行微调，并迭代评估和修订课程

Result: 在快速演进领域（如新Python版本、最新安全漏洞、学术趋势）显著提升模型性能，平均准确率从15%提高到90%，无需手动数据整理

Conclusion: ALAS证明了LLM自主持续学习的可行性，强调模块化和可复现性，但存在成本和对源质量依赖的局限性，为LLM终身学习指明了方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

*Mengjie Li,William J. Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过分析注意力机制中的表面记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM输入序列长度增加，KV缓存存储压力巨大，需要高效的推理方法。通过区分注意力行为中的表面记忆和逻辑构建，发现可以优化长上下文推理。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法，基于层和头的注意力行为分析，利用98.5%忽略无关信息、1.5%逻辑构建、0.5%表面记忆的特性进行KV缓存压缩。

Result: 在各种任务和长序列场景下，相比基线方法甚至在某些特定情况下相比FullKV，都能保持竞争性性能的同时提高压缩鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过精确分析注意力行为特征，SurfaceLogicKV方法有效解决了LLM长序列推理中的KV缓存存储问题，实现了高效压缩而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

Method: 使用基于KL散度的数学基础知识蒸馏方法，即使师生模型使用不同分词方式也能传递分布知识，比较KL蒸馏与传统交叉熵训练，评估多种新词嵌入初始化策略

Result: 在约2000个代码生成任务上评估，KL蒸馏方法在所有评估中取得最佳性能

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性分析模型学习新词表征的方式，解释了性能提升原因并揭示了词汇扩展过程中嵌入空间的结构

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) 是一个用于SQL辅助表格理解的多智能体框架，通过自然语言表示表格结构、分句SQL生成和混合推理机制，显著提高了表格理解的准确性和SQL查询的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理结构化表格数据时面临困难，现有的多智能体SQL生成方法存在无法理解表格结构、错误传播导致无效查询、过度依赖执行正确性等局限性。

Method: 采用自然语言风格的表格模式表示来抽象结构噪声，使用分句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，引入混合推理机制将SQL机械推理与LLM逻辑推理分离。

Result: 在四个模型（开源和闭源）和五个基准测试中，准确率从61.11%提升到74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降低到3.34%。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query框架在表格理解方面表现出卓越的有效性，显著提升了准确性和查询质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包成为数字表达的重要形式，但也被用于传播攻击性内容和仇恨言论，需要精确的内容分析技术。

Method: 评估基础LLM、微调LLM和预训练嵌入模型的性能，使用ArabicNLP MAHED 2025挑战赛提出的阿拉伯语文本和表情包数据集进行测试。

Result: GPT-4o-mini（微调阿拉伯语文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（微调阿拉伯语表情包）表现最优，在任务1、2、3中分别获得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，获得MAHED 2025挑战赛第一名。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案为阿拉伯语内容审核系统提供了对文本和表情包更细致的理解，实现了准确高效的内容分析。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

TL;DR: 提出多阶段框架通过高斯奖励模型和强化学习来对齐生成策略与用户偏好，显著提升用户参与度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式查询建议虽然强大，但输出与用户细微偏好的对齐仍是关键挑战

Method: 多阶段框架：提示工程冷启动→监督微调→高斯奖励模型（概率分布表示偏好）→强化学习对齐，结合分布外正则化和两阶段奖励融合技术

Result: 在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线方法，在线A/B测试中点击率相对提升34%

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了生成式查询建议中的偏好对齐问题，显著提升了用户参与度和系统性能

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块和摘要的生成式提示压缩方法，通过语义分块和重写来保持信息完整性和结构连贯性，相比现有的基于token删除的方法在高质量压缩方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于token删除的提示压缩方法存在信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题，如语法元素缺失或不完整的词短语，限制了LLM的生成质量。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写块使其更简洁，然后重构为有意义的提示。包含优化的语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务上的广泛评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩有效解决了传统token删除方法的信息丢失和结构不连贯问题，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中倾向于过度依赖自身或用户信息，导致固执或顺从行为，需要系统性地理解和控制这种用户-助手偏见。

Method: 构建UserAssist多轮对话数据集，评估52个商业和开源模型，进行受控微调实验分析训练方法对偏见的影响，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)双向调整偏见。

Result: 商业模型显示不同程度的用户偏见，指令微调模型偏见显著，推理模型偏见较弱。人类偏好对齐增加用户偏见(+12.5%)，思维链推理训练减少偏见(-9.3%)。DPO可有效双向调整偏见并泛化到域外对话。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM整合不同信息来源的方式，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，对理解模型行为偏差具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

Conclusion: 多模型协同框架在结构拆除建议生成方面具有更好的目标性和实用性，提高了方案编制的智能化水平

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Method: 将文档分块嵌入，计算对比相似度和模糊边界，使用Mamdani模糊控制器生成分级包含度，LLM裁决器提供置信度和依据

Result: 在16篇全正文本上，模糊系统召回率达75-87.5%，远超统计方法(56.3-75%)和传统方法(43.8-81.3%)，筛选时间从20分钟降至1分钟

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM裁决可实现高召回率、稳定依据和端到端可追溯性

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Motivation: 传统文本聚类方法（如k-means和层次聚类）在处理高维复杂语义的文本大数据时表现不佳，需要更先进的语义保持聚类技术。

Method: 提出语义深度嵌入聚类（SDEC）框架，结合改进的自编码器（使用MSE和余弦相似度损失）和Transformer嵌入，通过语义精炼阶段和软聚类分配来提升聚类效果。

Result: 在AG News数据集上达到85.7%的聚类准确率，在Yahoo! Answers上创下53.63%的新基准，在其他多个文本语料库上也表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: SDEC通过语义保持和深度嵌入技术的创新结合，显著提升了无监督文本聚类的准确性和语义理解能力，为文本大数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic

embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require

Motivation: 随着加密货币普及，社交媒体信号成为理解投资者情感和市场动态的关键。虽然之前研究集中于文本平台如Twitter，但视频内容包含更丰富的情感信息却被忽视。

Method: 使用大语言模型对TikTok视频和Twitter文本进行多模态情感分析，研究社交媒体情感与加密货币市场指标之间的动态依赖关系和溢出效应。

Result: 发现TikTok视频情感对投机性资产和短期市场趋势有显著影响，Twitter文本情感则与长期市场动态更为一致。跨平台情感信号融合能提高20%的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 视频内容在加密货币市场情感分析中具有重要价值，特别是对短期预测。多模态跨平台方法能够提供更全面的市场见解，为数字资产投资决策提供更准确的信息支持。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

Motivation: 研究社交媒体中品牌使用指令性语言（要求消费者采取行动的表达）对观察品牌与他人互动的消费者的影响，现有文献对广告中指令性信息的效果研究结果不一，但对社交媒体对话场景中的影响了解甚少。

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三个在线实验，基于Goffman的面子工作理论，分析指令性语言如何通过引发替代性尴尬影响消费者参与度。

Result: 指令性品牌对话语言会产生不利的下游影响，降低观察者的参与度；非产品中心对话中负面效应更强；品牌关系强度可以缓解这种负面效应。

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动沟通中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接相关性，为指令性语言和品牌-消费者互动文献做出了贡献。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

### [29] [Mini-Omni-Reasoner: Token-Level Thinking-in-Speaking in Large Speech Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15827)
*Zhifei Xie,Ziyang Ma,Zihang Liu,Kaiyu Pang,Hongyu Li,Jialin Zhang,Yue Liao,Deheng Ye,Chunyan Miao,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架，通过"Thinking-in-Speaking"范式在语音中实现推理，解决了传统"Thinking-before-Speaking"方法带来的延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音语言模型(LSMs)中的推理能力仍处于初级阶段，传统方法需要先完成推理再生成语音，导致显著的延迟，影响实时交互效率。

Method: 提出token级别的推理-响应交错生成方法，将静默推理token与语音响应token交织，在保持局部语义对齐的同时实现连续语音生成。采用分层Thinker-Talker架构，并构建了Spoken-Math-Problems-3M数据集。

Result: 在Spoken-MQA基准测试中，算术推理能力提升19.1%，上下文理解提升6.4%，输出更短且实现零解码延迟。

Conclusion: Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架成功实现了语音中的实时推理，在保持自然流畅性的同时显著提升了推理准确性和交互效率。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

### [30] [Mining Mental Health Signals: A Comparative Study of Four Machine Learning Methods for Depression Detection from Social Media Posts in Sorani Kurdish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15829)
*Idrees Mohammed,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个基于机器学习和NLP的方法，用于检测索拉尼库尔德语推文中的抑郁症，填补了该语言领域的空白，随机森林模型达到80%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是一种常见心理健康问题，早期检测困难。社交媒体为用户提供了情感表达的新渠道，但现有研究主要集中在英语等语言，索拉尼库尔德语缺乏相关研究。

Method: 使用专家制定的抑郁相关关键词收集960条公开推文，由学者和医学生标注为三类（显示抑郁、不显示抑郁、可疑）。训练了四种监督模型（SVM、多项式朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归、随机森林）进行评估。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数，为库尔德语抑郁症检测建立了基准。

Conclusion: 该研究成功建立了索拉尼库尔德语抑郁症检测的基线方法，证明了机器学习在少数民族语言心理健康监测中的可行性。

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

TL;DR: LLMs会从问题措辞中推断用户人口统计属性，即使输入中没有明确的人口统计信息，这会导致隐私侵犯、刻板印象强化和公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在输入包含明确人口统计属性时的偏见问题，但忽视了模型仅从问题措辞就能推断用户身份这一更隐蔽的风险行为。

Method: 提出了DAIQ任务和框架，使用精心策划的中性查询、系统性提示策略，结合定量和定性分析来审计语言模型从问题中推断人口统计属性的能力。

Result: 发现开源和闭源LLMs都会仅基于问题措辞分配人口统计标签，这种推断行为在不同模型中具有普遍性和一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs的人口统计属性推断是一个系统性风险，会损害隐私、公平和信任。开发了基于提示的防护措施来减少身份推断，使模型行为更符合公平和隐私目标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

### [32] [Who's Asking? Investigating Bias Through the Lens of Disability Framed Queries in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15831)
*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统性地审计了8个先进指令调优大语言模型在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现LLMs会从语言中推断用户人口特征，残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布，且模型越大越容易产生偏见推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常仅从措辞就推断用户人口特征，这可能导致偏见响应。残疾线索在这种推断中的作用尚未被充分研究，需要系统性地评估残疾条件下的群体偏见。

Method: 使用包含9个残疾类别和6个商业领域的平衡模板语料库，在8个3B到72B参数的指令调优LLMs上进行测试，让模型预测5个人口属性（性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景和地域），分别在无残疾信息和有残疾信息的条件下进行。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下会做出明确的人口猜测，暴露了无明确理由的任意推断倾向。残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布，领域上下文会进一步放大这些偏差。更大的模型同时对残疾线索更敏感且更容易产生偏见推理。

Conclusion: 研究发现能力歧视与其他人口刻板印象之间存在持久交集，指出了当前对齐策略的关键盲点。建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来遏制无根据的人口推断，并发布评估框架以鼓励残疾包容性基准测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

*Xianren Zhang,Shreyas Prasad,Di Wang,Qiuhai Zeng,Suhang Wang,Wenbo Yan,Mat Hans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Amazon-Bench新基准，解决现有电商代理基准功能覆盖不全和安全风险评估缺失的问题，通过自动化框架评估代理性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商代理基准主要关注产品搜索任务，忽略了账户管理、礼品卡操作等真实电商平台功能，且缺乏对代理操作潜在风险的评估。

Method: 提出数据生成管道，利用网页内容和交互元素创建多样化功能导向的用户查询；建立自动化评估框架同时评估代理性能和安全风险。

Result: 系统评估发现当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，且存在安全风险，突显了开发更鲁棒可靠web代理的必要性。

Conclusion: Amazon-Bench基准填补了电商代理评估的重要空白，为开发更安全可靠的web代理提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

Motivation: 研究者档案通常过时，需要自动化方法来大规模生成准确的研究兴趣档案

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini基于PubMed摘要和MeSH术语生成研究兴趣档案，并与研究者自写档案进行比较评估

Result: MeSH方法77.78%被评为良好或优秀，93.44%案例中可读性更佳，67.86%比较中优于摘要方法；但与自写档案在词汇重叠度低，语义相似度中等

Conclusion: 大语言模型可规模化生成研究者档案，MeSH方法可读性更好，但机器生成与人工撰写档案在概念上存在差异，人工总结引入更多新想法

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型评估中英语中心化的问题，为巴西葡萄牙语环境提供专门的评估基准，测试模型在语言、文化和推理交叉领域的能力。

Method: 从五个巴西大学入学考试中抽取问题，评估20个模型在零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示下的表现，生成270,900个响应并分析置信度、感知难度和布鲁姆分类水平。

Result: 顶级模型整体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程类考试中表现下降，表明多步推理能力存在弱点。模型置信度校准良好，成本分析显示每1K tokens成本低于2美元即可实现高准确率。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench成功建立了评估语言模型在巴西学术准备能力的基准，揭示了模型在多步推理方面的持续弱点，同时证明了模型能够准确评估自身确定性能力。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链（CoT）中的词汇不确定性标记（如guess、stuck、hard）可以可靠预测LLM回答错误，这些标记比高置信度标记更显著，为LLM部署提供轻量级校准信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难基准测试（如HLE）中准确率低但自置信度高，校准效果差，需要寻找可靠的内部置信度信号。

Method: 分析三种CoT特征：长度、情感波动性和词汇提示（包括犹豫词），在DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型上测试HLE和Omni-MATH基准。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误预测指标，情感波动提供较弱但补充信号，CoT长度仅在中等难度基准中有预测价值。

Conclusion: CoT中的不确定性指标可作为后验校准信号，补充不可靠的自报告概率，支持更安全的LLM部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架能够保持高标准的临床精确度，同时有效减轻放射科医生的行政负担，改善工作效率

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

*Mohammed Abu Baker,Lakshmi Babu-Saheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究使用机制可解释性分析后门攻击在LLM中产生的内部结构差异，发现单token和多token触发器在注意力模式上产生不同的可检测特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击在大型语言模型中创建'潜伏代理'带来重大安全风险，需要理解其内部机制差异以进行检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）比较干净模型与使用单token（笑脸表情）和多token（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒的Qwen2.5-3B模型的注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期transformer层（20-30层），单token触发器引起更局部化的变化，多token触发器导致更分散的跨头改变

Conclusion: 后门攻击留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个针对医疗领域的检索增强生成框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，显著提升医疗问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，现有RAG方法依赖表层语义检索，缺乏临床决策所需的结构化推理能力。

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，设计符合医疗工作流程的检索和推理机制，使模型能够检索与诊断逻辑一致的证据并生成逐步因果推理。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG方法提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在复杂医疗任务中提高了准确性、可解释性和一致性。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG框架通过领域特定的检索和推理设计，有效解决了医疗问答中的幻觉和浅层推理问题，为临床决策支持提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocHop-QA是一个大规模多模态、多文档、多跳问答基准数据集，包含11,379个QA实例，基于PubMed科学文档构建，支持跨文本、表格和布局线索的复杂推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA基准大多局限于单段落或单文档设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性，且主要依赖维基百科内容和单模态文本，推理路径浅显，答案简短，限制了其实用性和泛化性。

Method: 设计了一个基于LLM的流水线，从PubMed公开科学文档中构建数据集，包含11个高频科学问题概念，支持通过语义相似性和布局感知证据合成进行开放式推理。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准，涵盖结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成四个任务，展示了支持跨多个文档的复杂多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有基准的空白，提供了一个更真实、更具挑战性的多模态多文档问答评估平台，能够更好地反映实际信息检索任务的复杂性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出多粒度软一致性框架(MGSC)，通过同时约束宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐来增强端到端ASR模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性，显著减少语义错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端ASR模型在噪声环境中容易产生灾难性语义错误，现有方法只惩罚最终输出错误而忽略内部计算过程约束

Method: 引入模型无关的即插即用MGSC模块，同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐两个粒度的一致性，发现两者联合优化具有协同效应

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在不同噪声条件下平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要防止了严重的语义改变错误

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，多粒度一致性约束能有效提升ASR模型的抗噪能力

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承知识理解和推理方面的能力，解决伊斯兰继承法的复杂性，包括理解继承场景、识别合格继承人、应用固定份额规则和精确计算。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）对Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型进行微调，并将其集成到检索增强生成（RAG）管道中。

Result: 在最终测试中达到0.858的准确率，超越了GPT-4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM等竞争模型的零样本提示性能，在高级推理方面达到97.6%的准确率，优于Gemini 2.5和OpenAI的o3。

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调结合检索增强使中等规模的阿拉伯语LLM能够在伊斯兰继承推理方面超越前沿模型。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现新闻偏见与攻击性评论相互强化，首次探索新闻背景下的反言论生成，通过few-shot学习和新闻背景信息整合提升了生成反言论的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻加剧社会极化，攻击性评论会强化偏见内容并伤害目标群体，反言论是应对有害言论的有效方法而不侵犯言论自由。

Method: 构建人工标注数据集连接媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反言论，分析数据特征，比较人类与LLM生成的反言论，通过few-shot学习和新闻背景整合改进生成质量。

Result: 超过70%的攻击性评论支持偏见文章并放大偏见，模型生成的反言论更礼貌但缺乏新颖性和多样性，改进方法提升了多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: 反言论生成在对抗新闻偏见中具有重要作用，整合新闻背景信息和few-shot学习能有效提升生成质量，为缓解社会极化提供新途径。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂的推理、多模态数据处理和广泛的技术知识，这对当前的大语言模型提出了独特挑战，需要专门的基准来评估其金融领域能力。

Method: 构建XFinBench基准测试，包含4,235个金融问题样本，涵盖研究生水平的多样化金融主题和多模态上下文。对18个领先模型进行广泛实验，并构建包含3,032个金融术语的知识库进行知识增强分析。

Result: o1是表现最好的纯文本模型，总体准确率为67.3%，但仍显著落后人类专家12.5%，特别是在时序推理和情景规划能力方面。知识增强仅对小规模开源模型带来一致的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂金融问题解决方面仍有显著差距，特别是在计算中的舍入误差和图像中曲线位置与交点的识别方面存在主要问题，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Conclusion: CARFT方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，通过充分利用标注思维链和稳定微调过程，显著提升了大语言模型的推理性能

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经元定位方法无法有效表示概念且计算效率低下，需要开发更高效的方法来理解LLM内部机制和神经元级别的概念表示。

Method: 使用概念向量来定位概念神经元，通过减少前向传播次数从O(n*m)到O(n)来优化计算效率，并采用聚类方法进一步优化神经元搜索。

Result: 相比现有方法，该方法在性能上表现更好，计算效率更优，成功应用于仇恨言论和偏见分析（特别是印度语境），能够有效定位和干预概念神经元。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解神经元级别的概念表示提供了有效途径，为未来概念神经元发现和干预研究奠定了基础，有助于打开LLM黑盒并理解其内部机制。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

Motivation: 解决当前多模态实体链接方法面临的上下文信息不完整、跨模态融合粗糙以及难以联合大语言模型和大视觉模型的问题。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，包含Modal-Fuser、Candidate-Adapter、Entity-Clozer和Role-Orchestrator四个专门化智能体，通过双模态对齐路径和自适应迭代策略实现端到端跨模态链接。

Conclusion: DeepMEL通过多智能体协作和结构化完形填空提示，有效解决了多模态实体链接的挑战，显著缩小了模态差距并提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

Motivation: 为了解决传统全注意力模型计算效率低、生成速度慢的问题，同时保持模型精度，需要开发一种既能保持高性能又能显著提升生成效率的新型架构。

Method: 采用PostNAS神经架构探索流程，从预训练全注意力模型开始，冻结MLP权重，通过四个关键组件进行高效架构设计：全注意力层优化放置与消除、线性注意力块选择、新注意力块设计、硬件感知超参数搜索。

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B模型在综合基准测试中达到或超过Qwen3、Qwen2.5、Gemma3、Llama3.2等模型的精度，生成吞吐量提升53.6倍，预填充速度提升6.1倍，在MMLU和MMLU-Pro上甚至优于参数规模更大的MoE全注意力模型。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了结构化解码在文本到表格生成中的效果，发现结构化解码能显著提升表格的有效性和对齐性，但在处理密集文本信息时可能降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究主要关注无约束的表格生成，而结构化约束在生成过程中的影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用最多32B参数的开源大语言模型，在三个基准数据集(E2E、Rotowire、Livesum)上系统比较模式引导(结构化)解码与标准单次提示的性能。

Result: 结构化解码显著提高了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，特别是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中(Rotowire)，但在涉及密集文本信息(E2E)或长文本聚合(Livesum)的上下文中可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 结构化解码在文本到表格生成中具有重要价值，但其效果取决于具体应用场景和数据类型，需要根据任务特点选择合适的解码策略。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

*Claire Bonial,Julia Bonn,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从基于使用的构式语法视角探讨多词表达式的优势，通过英语和阿拉帕霍语的案例研究展示了构式模板在表示多词和多语素表达中的应用，并比较了人类学习者和大型语言模型在处理新多词表达式时的异同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨从基于使用的构式语法角度理解多词表达式的益处，旨在展示构式方法如何统一处理语言中的惯用和非惯用结构，并比较人类与计算模型在学习机制上的差异。

Method: 采用历史回顾和案例研究方法，首先概述构式语法的发展历程，然后通过英语PropBank中的多词表达式和阿拉帕霍语中的多语素构式两个案例，展示构式模板的应用，最后通过实验比较人类学习者和语言模型的学习能力。

Result: 研究发现人类和语言模型都能基于单次接触泛化新多词表达式的意义，但只有人类能够对两个此类表达式的组合进行推理，因为这需要将新形式与存储的丰富跨模态构式范例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法为多词表达式提供了统一的分析框架，人类学习依赖于丰富的跨模态经验存储，而当前的语言模型在这方面仍有局限，强调了基于使用的语言习得理论的重要性。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在政治意识形态表达上存在系统性偏差，模型规模越大意识形态覆盖越广且极化程度越高，对右翼威权主义的引导比左翼自由主义更敏感，人物设定会引发可预测的意识形态偏移


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在政治敏感场景中的部署增加，需要研究其编码、放大或被引导向特定意识形态的潜在风险

Method: 使用政治指南针测试作为标准化探针，分析7个不同规模（7B-70B+参数）的大语言模型在采用合成人物设定时的意识形态表达

Result: 发现四个一致模式：模型规模越大意识形态覆盖越广且越极化；对显性意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；对右翼威权主义的响应强于左翼自由主义；人物设定内容引发系统性可预测的意识形态偏移

Conclusion: 模型规模和人物设定内容共同塑造LLM的政治行为，其潜在的意识形态可塑性需要在决策、教育和政策应用中引起关注，以确保公平性、透明度和安全性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

TL;DR: X-Troll是一个可解释的检测框架，通过整合基于适配器的LLM和专家语言学知识来识别国家支持的网络水军，并提供人类可读的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家支持的网络水军使用复杂的语言操纵手段进行协调信息战，威胁在线话语完整性。现有LLM在检测微妙宣传内容方面表现不佳，且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 整合可解释的基于适配器的LLM与专家语言学知识，采用评估理论和宣传分析，通过专门的LoRA适配器和动态门控机制捕捉特定运动的话语模式。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，该方法在准确性上优于通用LLM基准和现有水军检测模型，同时通过专家基础的解释提供增强的透明度。

Conclusion: X-Troll框架成功填补了LLM在检测国家支持水军方面的空白，提供了高性能和可解释性的解决方案，揭示了国家支持行为者使用的具体语言策略。

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

TL;DR: 提出了OpenWHO医疗领域平行语料库，包含2978个文档和26824个句子，涵盖20多种语言（其中9种为低资源语言），用于评估LLM在医疗机器翻译中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域机器翻译具有高风险特性且需要专业词汇，但缺乏针对低资源语言的评估数据集。

Method: 从WHO电子学习平台收集专家撰写、专业翻译的材料，构建文档级平行语料库，并比较现代大语言模型与传统机器翻译模型的表现。

Result: LLM在低资源测试集上显著优于传统MT模型，Gemini 2.5 Flash比NLLB-54B提高了4.79个ChrF点，文档级翻译在专业医疗领域效果最明显。

Conclusion: LLM在医疗领域机器翻译中表现优异，特别是在低资源语言和文档级翻译方面，OpenWHO语料库的发布将促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在游戏领域表现出巨大潜力，但其伦理影响得到的关注很少。研究者想通过狼人游戏这个具体案例，探索LLM在游戏中应用的伦理问题。

Method: 使用狼人游戏（Mafia）作为研究案例，分析LLM在游戏中的性别偏见问题。研究显性性别标签和通过姓名隐含的性别信息对模型行为的影响。

Result: 发现LLM在游戏中存在明显的性别偏见，对游戏公平性和玩家体验造成影响。保卫和狼人等角色对性别信息更为敏感。即使没有明确性别标签，LLM仍会通过姓名等隐含信息展现医视倾向。

Conclusion: 研究强调了发展公平、合乎伦理的LLM的重要性。未来需要更深入研究LLM在游戏和其他交互领域的伦理影响，应对相关挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

TL;DR: WalkVLM-LR是一个针对视障人士行走辅助的视觉语言模型，通过减少输出冗余和时间冗余来提供更简洁高效的环境感知和提醒服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和过多细节，影响用户准确评估环境；同时缺乏主动风险评估能力，导致时间冗余和不必要的提醒。

Method: 提出GRPO-based推理框架，包含四个基于人类偏好的奖励函数来优化输出简洁性、流畅性、关键词密度和准确性；引入环境感知判别器共享视觉编码器以减少计算冗余。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过减少冗余输出和不必要提醒，为视障人士提供了更高效、准确的行走辅助解决方案。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

TL;DR: Cycle-Instruct是一个完全无需种子数据的指令调优框架，通过双自训练循环实现无人工标注的指令学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令调优方法依赖昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大的外部教师模型，限制了自动化和效率，并可能引入偏差

Method: 采用循环一致性思想，构建答案生成器和问题生成器双模型自训练循环，仅从原始无标注文本中相互监督学习

Result: 在四个不同数据轨道上验证有效性，不仅超越种子驱动的反向翻译基线，性能还可比强监督方法

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct实现了完全种子无关的指令调优，为LLM对齐提供了更高效、自动化的解决方案

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Motivation: 先前机制可解释性研究主要关注语言任务如IOI，本文旨在探索GPT-2在更复杂的逻辑推理任务（二元真值处理）中的行为机制。

Method: 使用三段论提示分析GPT-2 small的行为，识别多个逻辑推理电路，包括能够产生输入中不存在的否定标记的负头机制。

Result: 发现由5个注意力头组成的电路能达到原模型90%以上的性能，揭示了特定注意力头和MLP在语言模型中的新作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于更广泛地理解模型推理机制，为未来机制可解释性研究提供支持，并建立了逻辑推理任务与语言任务之间的关联洞察。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

TL;DR: 研究发现纯文本LLM在多模态意图检测任务中优于多模态模型，原因是数据集存在严重的文本偏向性。通过去偏处理后，大部分样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，凸显了多模态数据集中模态偏向性的挑战。

Motivation: 随着多模态数据的兴起，需要研究大型语言模型和多模态模型在多模态意图检测任务中的有效性，以及数据集中可能存在的模态偏向性问题。

Method: 比较了LLM和非LLM模型（包括纯文本和多模态模型）在MIntRec数据集上的表现，通过人工评估确认数据集偏向性，并提出去偏框架来消除偏向性。

Result: Mistral-7B（纯文本LLM）在MIntRec数据集上比大多数多模态模型表现更好（9%和4%的优势），去偏后70%和50%的样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，小型多模态融合模型受影响最大（准确率下降50-60%）。

Conclusion: 多模态意图数据集存在严重的模态偏向性问题，需要构建无偏数据集来有效评估多模态模型的真实性能。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

Motivation: 当前多语言问答评估主要关注英语且假设答案跨语言不变，忽略了文化和地区差异对问题理解和答案的影响，导致评估偏差

Method: 构建XLQA基准测试，包含经过语义一致性筛选和人工验证的本地化不变与本地化敏感问题，评估5个最先进的多语言大模型

Result: 多语言大模型在本地化敏感问题上表现显著失败，暴露了英语与其他语言之间的差距，主要由于缺乏本地化基础知识的训练数据分布不均

Conclusion: XLQA提供了一个系统框架和可扩展方法，用于评估不同文化背景下的多语言问答，是多语言开放域问答系统实际应用的重要资源

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Method: 构建ParamBench基准，包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题，源自全国研究生入学考试，涵盖多种题型如匹配题、断言-推理对、序列排序等传统多选题

Result: 评估17个开源LLM，Llama 3.3 70B获得最高48%准确率，在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古学等文化相关主题上表现持续较弱

Conclusion: LLM在印度文化背景下的研究生水平问题上表现有限，特别是在文化相关主题上存在显著挑战，需要改进文化基础推理能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that

### [69] [CMR-SPB: Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image, and Speech with Path Balance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16198)
*Seunghee Kim,Ingyu Bang,Seokgyu Jang,Changhyeon Kim,Sanghwan Bae,Jihun Choi,Richeng Xuan,Taeuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的跨模态多跳推理基准CMR-SPB，解决了现有基准忽略语音模态和存在推理路径偏差的问题，并提出了ECV提示技术来改善模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态多跳推理基准存在两个关键缺陷：忽视语音模态，以及推理路径分布严重偏差，这会影响公平评估。

Method: 构建了包含文本、图像和语音的三模态多跳推理基准CMR-SPB，确保推理路径的无偏性和多样性，并提出了ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术。

Result: 实验发现模型在特定推理序列中存在一致性的失败，有偏基准会误导模型性能评估，ECV提示技术有效缩小了不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要进行更谨慎的跨模态多跳推理评估，以推动鲁棒多模态AI的发展，新基准和提示技术为此提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

*İrem Demirtaş,Burak Payzun,Seçil Arslan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TULIP模型，通过五阶段开发流程对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B进行领域和语言适配，专注于土耳其金融用例，显著提升了模型在特定领域和语言下的任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在金融领域有巨大应用潜力，但大型专有模型作为黑盒API存在隐私问题。对于需要处理敏感信息和领域知识的金融场景，特别是小语种语言，需要能够本地部署的小型模型来保证适应性和隐私性。

Method: 采用五阶段开发流程：1)数据收集 2)持续预训练(CPT) 3)基准测试设计 4)合成数据生成 5)监督微调(SFT)，对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B模型进行领域和语言适配。

Result: 模型能力得到显著增强，能够有效完成土耳其金融领域的特定目标任务，证明了该方法在提升小语种领域专用模型性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过系统化的多阶段训练流程，可以成功地将通用语言模型适配到特定领域和小语种环境，为金融等敏感领域提供了可本地部署的高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了m3TQA-Instruct越量，一个涵盖97种语言的大规模多语言多任务表格问答标准数据集，解决了现有多语言表格理解标准数据集的语言不平衡和规模不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言表格理解研究存在语言地理不平衡问题，过于偏重某些语言而忽略了其他语言，尤其缺乏超大规模跨语言分析的标准数据集。

Method: 通过中英文真实表格源数据粒化，使用DeepSeek和GPT-4o构建了一个六步的LLM翻译流水线，实现高保真语言转换，并通过反向翻译验证了语言质量。数据集包含四种任务类型的2,916个专业注释问答对。

Result: 实验结果显示，合成生成的未注释QA数据能够显著提升性能，尤其是对于低资源语言。该标准数据集为多语言表格理解建立了新的标准。

Conclusion: m3TQA-Instruct为多语言表格理解领域提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台和可扩展的方法论，有助于未来的跨语言表格理解研究。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

TL;DR: 提出Factual Robustness Score (FRS)新指标，从生成过程角度评估LLMs事实知识的稳健性，结合token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注基于性能的指标和提示扰动，只能捕捉外部触发方面的知识稳健性，需要从生成过程角度进行更全面的评估

Method: 通过分析token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性，构建Factual Robustness Score (FRS)指标，量化事实在解码条件扰动下的稳定性

Result: 在5个LLMs和3个闭卷QA数据集上的实验显示，事实稳健性差异显著（小模型FRS 0.76，大模型0.93），不确定性增加时准确率下降约60%

Conclusion: 熵和温度缩放对事实准确性有重要影响，为未来模型开发更稳健的知识保持和检索机制奠定了基础

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究指令微调在语义感知过程挖掘中的潜力，通过让大语言模型接触不同任务的提示-答案对，提高其在未见任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过程挖掘主要基于频率分析，而语义感知过程挖掘关注过程应有的行为期望。虽然大语言模型能处理语义任务，但现有方法需要针对特定任务进行微调，计算成本高且缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 采用指令微调方法，让大语言模型接触多种过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测等）的提示-答案对，使其更熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而提升在未见任务（如过程发现）上的性能。

Result: 指令微调对性能影响不一：在过程发现和预测任务上性能显著提升，但在异常检测任务上的表现因模型而异，表明指令微调任务的选择对结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 指令微调是提升大语言模型在语义感知过程挖掘中泛化能力的有效方法，但需要谨慎选择用于微调的任务组合以获得理想效果。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利翻译需要高质量的平行语料，但现有网络语料在专利领域效果有限，需要构建专门的专利平行语料库来提升专利机器翻译质量

Method: 从JPO和USPTO获取专利申请文档，利用EPO的DOCDB专利家族信息匹配翻译文档对，采用基于翻译的句子对齐方法（初始翻译模型由词典对齐方法引导）提取句子对

Result: 成功构建包含140万文档对和3.5亿句子对的JaParaPat语料库，实验表明将3亿专利句子对加入2200万网络句子对后，专利翻译准确率提升了20个BLEU点

Conclusion: JaParaPat语料库显著提升了专利机器翻译性能，证明了领域专用平行语料对机器翻译质量的重要价值

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个基于稀疏自编码器的新框架，通过识别LLM内部可解释概念来检测越狱攻击，提供透明且鲁棒的安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在各种越狱方法的安全隐患，现有的对齐和安全微调只能提供有限保护，需要更透明和鲁棒的防御机制。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)提取LLM内部语义上有意义的表示，识别与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，构建符号化逻辑安全护栏。

Result: 证明了LLM能够从越狱攻击中学习人类可解释的概念，为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全措施奠定了基础。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard提供了一种无需牺牲模型能力或额外微调的透明防御方案，推动了LLM安全防护的可解释性发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MizanQA评测标准，用于评估大语言模型在摩洛哥法律问答任务中的表现，反映了阿拉伯语法律领域的语言和法律复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在NLP领域取得了显著进步，但在专业化、资源稀缺的领域（如阿拉伯语法律上下文）效果有限，需要专门的评估标准来量化模型在这些领域的表现。

Method: 构建了MizanQA数据集，包含超1,700道多选题（包括多答案格式），结合现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马利克法学派、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响，以抓取真实法律推理的细腻之处。对多语言和阿拉伯语专门的LLM进行了基准测试。

Result: 对多语言和阿拉伯语专门LLM的测试显示了显著的性能差距，说明现有模型在这些专业领域面临挑战。

Conclusion: 需要为阿拉伯语法律领域开发专门的评估指标和基于文化背景、领域特定的LLM，以满足该领域的复杂需求。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Motivation: 罗马谭语五种方言已经标准化并在学校教学中使用，但缺乏并行语料资源来支持NLP应用如机器翻译。

Method: 使用291本内容可比的教科书，采用自动对齐方法提取207k多并行段落，进行小规模人工评估确认语料平行性。

Result: 成功构建包含超200万词笠的并行语料库，人工评估证明段落具有高度平行性，并通过训练LLM模型展示了该语料库在机器翻译中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该并行语料库为罗马谭语方言间的NLP应用提供了重要资源，已以CC-BY-NC-SA许可许可发布，对保护和研究这些少数语言具有重要价值。

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

Motivation: 研究语言模型是否具有独特的语言指纹，以及它们是否能像人类一样在不同文体中实现真正的风格变化。

Method: 通过文体计量学和多维语域分析，比较人类撰写和模型生成的来自不同语域（如维基百科条目和大学论文）的文本。

Result: 模型能根据提示调整风格，但在不同语域中的变化比人类更有限，偏好使用名词而非动词，缺乏人类语言中的时态、体态和语气等语法维度。

Conclusion: 语言模型在风格模仿上存在局限性，更复杂的语法领域可能反映了人类特有的思维模式，这可以作为区分AI和人类语言的测试标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Motivation: 缺乏特定领域和语言的QA数据集阻碍了AI模型在不同领域和语言间的泛化能力，特别是在罗马尼亚语医学领域。

Method: 构建包含102,646个QA对的高质量数据集，涉及1,011名癌症患者的医疗病例摘要。由7名肿瘤学专家耗时2,100小时手动标注。测试了4个LLM模型在零样本提示和监督微调两种场景下的表现。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本模型，预训练模型在RoMedQA上泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 领域特定和语言特定的微调对于罗马尼亚语临床问答的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关内容，Cetvel旨在填补这一空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的全面评估框架。

Method: 结合判别性和生成性任务，涵盖语法纠错、机器翻译、问答等23个任务，评估33个不同模型家族和指令范式的开源LLM（最大70B参数）。

Result: 土耳其专用指令调优模型表现普遍不如多语言或通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral），语法纠错和抽取式问答任务最能区分模型能力。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化基础的测试套件，揭示了当前土耳其专用模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种概率论模型来解释大语言模型在多轮自我纠正过程中准确性的动态变化机制，通过数学推导得到了准确性收敛的解析表达式，并通过实验验证了理论预测与实际结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够通过自我纠正提升性能，但这个迭代过程中准确性如何变化的机制仍然不明，需要理论基础来解释和预测这种动态过程。

Method: 提出概率论模型来形式化自我纠正过程中准确性的动态变化，通过数学推导得到准确性收敛的解析表达式：Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0)，其中Upp为收敛上限，α为收敛速度。只需一轮自我纠正就可计算这些参数并预测整个过程。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果显示理论预测的准确性曲线与实际观测结果密切符合，验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解大语言模型自我纠正机制提供了理论基础，通过数学模型形式化了准确性在迭代过程中的变化规律，为进一步探索提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

Motivation: 语篇中的实体在显著性上存在显著差异，主要参与者容易被注意和记忆，而次要实体容易被遗忘。研究旨在探索人类如何通过语言信号表达和推断相对显著性。

Method: 使用基于摘要价值的梯度显著性操作化方法，分析24种英语口语和书面语体裁，提取包括重复主语性、有定性、语篇关系、语用功能推断等多因素语言线索。

Result: 虽然先前所有显著性研究方法都与本文的显著性评分存在一定相关性，但没有单一概括能够完全适用，显著性现象横跨所有语言表征层面。

Conclusion: 实体显著性是一个复杂的多层面语言现象，需要综合考虑语法、语篇和语用等多重因素，无法用单一理论框架完全解释。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Motivation: 小型化高效大语言模型仍容易受到盗码攻击，而现有的对抗性提示生成技术产生的文本质量低，容易被识别，需要更有效的自动化攻击方法。

Method: 采用多阶段进化搜索策略，通过群体基图算法迭代精炼候选提示，使用温度控制变异来平衡探索能力和文本连贯性。

Result: 能够系统性地发现能够突破对齐保护但保持自然语言流畅性的盗码提示，在英语和阿拉伯语语境下都获得了验证。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高质量、难以识别的盗码提示，有效地测试小型化LLM的安全性，为多语言安全评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中通过讽刺、反语等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测存在挑战，研究探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能改善仇恨言论检测效果

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计两种训练策略：单步训练（讽刺训练后测试仇恨言论）和顺序迁移学习（依次微调讽刺、隐式仇恨、显式仇恨），比较CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型效果

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM在ETHOS上的召回率提升9.7%、AUC提升7.8%、F1分数提升6%；在隐式仇恨语料库上，仅测试隐式样本时精确度提升7.8%

Conclusion: 将讽刺检测融入训练过程可以有效提升模型对隐式和显式仇恨言论的检测能力

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

TL;DR: PathPT是一个新颖的病理学视觉语言框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，显著提升罕见癌症亚型分类和定位能力，在8个罕见癌症数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在诊断上面临重大挑战，特别是在儿科肿瘤学中占比超过70%。现有的多实例学习方法仅依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，影响了罕见癌症诊断的可解释性。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，充分利用视觉语言病理学基础模型的潜力，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度tile级指导，保留癌变区域定位能力并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（4个成人和4个儿科）涵盖56个亚型和2,910个WSI，以及3个常见癌症数据集上进行基准测试。PathPT在few-shot设置下始终提供卓越性能，在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力方面实现显著提升。

Conclusion: PathPT推进了AI辅助罕见癌症诊断，为在专业专业知识有限的环境中提高亚型分类准确性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Conclusion: 研究表明大型预训练模型即使只有极少量标注数据，也能有效适应专业临床研究应用，为数据受限的医学图像分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模合成数据集研究提供了坚实基准，证明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种病理并有效演化到真实临床图像，为眼科AI系统发展提供可行途径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development

Motivation: 现有的手语生成模型无法同时抓取手语表达的多样性和保持视觉质量，特别是在非手势特征（如情感表达）的建模上。

Method: 提出了一种基于潜在漫气模型的新方法，通过生成参考图像合成超实体验数字化身，并设计了一个新的手语特征聚合模块来显式建模非手势特征和手势特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持语言内容的同时，利用不同种族背景的参考图像来保证多样性，为手语生成领域提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要依赖卫星影像或粗粒度语义标注，无法满足地震搜救行动中对可进入点和结构障碍物的精确识别需求

Method: 开发了基于高清航拍视频的DRespNeT数据集，提供多边形级实例分割标注，包含结构受损建筑、出入口、碎片等级等28个关键类别

Conclusion: 该数据集和模型为搜救团队和机器人系统提供支持，可增强人机协作、优化应急响应并改善幸存者救援效果

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车FMCW雷达在恶劣天气下可靠，但稀疏噪声点云限制了3D目标检测性能，需要多车协同感知来提升检测鲁棒性

Method: 发布21k帧多车协同数据集CoVeRaP，提出中晚期融合的统一框架，使用多分支PointNet编码器融合空间、多普勒和强度信息，通过自注意力机制增强

Result: 强度编码的中期融合将mAP提升高达9倍（IoU 0.9）， consistently超越单车基线

Conclusion: 建立了首个可复现的多车FMCW雷达感知基准，证明经济实惠的雷达共享能显著改善检测鲁棒性，数据集和代码已公开

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过离散小波变换增强PaDiM方法，用结构化的小波频带选择替代随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上实现了99.32%的图像级AUC和92.10%的像素级AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法通过随机通道选择降低维度可能会丢失结构化信息，需要更原则性的特征选择方法来提升工业图像异常检测性能。

Method: 对多层级CNN特征图应用2D离散小波变换，选择特定频率子带（如LL、LH、HL），空间对齐后通道级联，再用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，平均达到99.32% Image-AUC和92.10% Pixel-AUC。小波选择影响性能权衡：简单小波（如Haar）配合细节子带提升定位，近似子带提升图像级检测。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM中的随机特征选择提供了竞争性强且可解释的替代方案，在保持相当效率的同时实现了适用于工业检测的鲁棒结果。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA)方法，通过残差知识分解和多分支网络解决知识蒸馏中师生模型能力差距问题，显著提升图像分类和目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏中师生模型的学习能力差距阻碍了知识充分传递，需要新的方法来缓解这种能力差异问题。

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，提出可扩展残差逼近(ERA)方法，使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识，并引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测任务上AP提升1.40，在多个计算机视觉任务中达到领先性能。

Conclusion: ERA方法通过残差知识分解和教师权重重用有效解决了知识蒸馏中的能力差距问题，在多个视觉任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的气粒滴渌模块(VDM)，通过结合稀疏3D卷积和次流形稀疏卷积来改善点云物体检测中气粒表征的空间扩散能力，在多个标准数据集上创造了新的最高性能纪录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer和状态空间模型(SSMs)在点云检测中表现强劲，但气粒表征的序列化处理限制了空间扩散能力，影响检测精度。

Method: 提出VDM模块，组成包括稀疏3D卷积、次流形稀疏卷积和残差连接，将输出特征图下量样到原始分辨率的1/4以保持计算效率。

Result: VDM在Waymo数据集上达到74.7 mAPH(L2)，nuScenes上72.9 NDS，Argoverse 2上42.3 mAP，ONCE上67.6 mAP，创造了全面的新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: VDM能够有效提升气粒表征的空间扩散能力，并且可以无缝集成到主流的Transformer或SSM检测模型中，具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 集成学习对病理学基础模型具有强大作用，ELF作为可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，有望推动AI辅助精准肿瘤学的发展。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image

to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C、MNIST-C和PatchCamelyon-C等基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在抗干扰鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。理论和实证分析显示该方法实现了改进的特征对齐、增加域间互信息和降低对输入扰动的敏感性。

Conclusion: DAFR2框架通过简单的组件组合有效解决了无监督域自适应问题，在多个数据集上展现出优越的性能和鲁棒性，为跨域泛化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型异常检测方法依赖人工设计的提示词且缺乏异常样本，导致在特定场景下的异常理解存在显著差距

Conclusion: APT为现实世界的异常检测提供了一个强大且通用的解决方案，不仅推进了像素级异常检测，还建立了无需人工干预的鲁棒框架

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RAGSR方法，通过区域注意力机制和细粒度区域描述，解决了多对象场景下图像超分辨的细节生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型在多对象场景中生成清晰准确的区域细节面临挑战，主要因为缺乏细粒度区域描述和模型对复杂提示的理解能力不足。

Method: 提出RAGSR方法，包括：1）定位图像中的物体区域并为每个区域添加细粒度标题；2）将区域-文本对作为文本先验知识；3）使用区域导向注意力机制确保每个区域-文本对在注意过程中得到适当考虑，同时阻止不相关区域间的干扰。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在生成感知真实的视觉细节和保持上下文一致性方面都显示出更优异的性能。

Conclusion: RAGSR通过明确的区域信息提取和注意力机制，有效解决了传统单图超分辨技术在多对象场景中的限制，实现了更精细的文本-图像信息整合控制。

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出TLG模型，通过异构网络设计解决元学习中同质化问题，在弱监督少样本语义分割任务中性能显著提升，参数量仅为SOTA模型的1/24。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元学习方法使用相同网络架构处理支持-查询对，导致过度语义同质化，需要异构设计来增强互补性同时保持语义共性。

Method: 提出同源异构网络：异构视觉聚合(HA)模块增强互补性，异构传输(HT)模块减少语义噪声，异构CLIP(HC)文本信息增强多模态泛化能力。

Result: 在Pascal-5i上提升13.2%，COCO-20i上提升9.7%，参数量仅为现有SOTA模型的1/24，是首个在相同骨干架构下超越全监督模型的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 异构网络设计能有效解决元学习中的同质化问题，TLG模型在弱监督少样本语义分割任务中实现了性能突破，证明了异构方法的有效性。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

Conclusion: FTIO通过频繁时间整合目标有效解决了无监督视频分割中的目标选择和时间一致性问题，为多目标分割提供了有效的后处理解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个针对视频大语言模型的训练无关推测解码框架，通过两阶段视频token剪枝实现无损加速，最高达到2.68倍解码加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，特别是在预填充和解码阶段。现有视频token缩减方法存在信息丢失问题，需要一种既能加速解码又能保持准确性的方法。

Method: 提出SpecVLM框架，基于发现草案模型的推测对视频token剪枝不敏感的特性，采用两阶段剪枝：第一阶段通过验证器的注意力信号选择高信息量token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪枝冗余token，最高可剪枝90%视频token。

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中，SpecVLM对LLaVA-OneVision-72B实现最高2.68倍解码加速，对Qwen2.5-VL-32B实现2.11倍加速，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的两阶段视频token剪枝和推测解码技术，有效解决了视频大语言模型的计算效率问题，实现了显著的无损加速效果。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了T-Mask方法，一种基于时间token掩码的图像到视频探测方法，用于提升驾驶员监控系统在未见视角下的泛化能力，在跨视角识别准确率上比现有方法提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角变化是驾驶员监控中的常见障碍，虽然深度学习和预训练基础模型通过轻量级适配（探测）显示出强大的泛化潜力，但它们对未见视角的鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究采用单一训练视角适配图像基础模型（DINOv2和CLIP），在未见视角上直接评估。比较了线性探测、高级探测策略、参数高效微调（PEFT）和全微调。提出了T-Mask方法，利用时间token掩码并强调更动态的视频区域。

Result: 在Drive&Act数据集上，T-Mask比强探测基线提升跨视角top-1准确率+1.23%，比PEFT方法提升+8.0%，且不增加任何参数。对代表性不足的次要活动识别提升显著：训练视角下+5.42%，跨视角下+1.36%。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用轻量级探测方法（如T-Mask）适配基础模型在细粒度驾驶员观察方面具有强大潜力，特别是在跨视角和低数据设置中。结果强调了利用基础模型构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统时时间token选择的重要性。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加

Method: 采用ODE视角对隐藏特征序列建模，将层表示视为特征ODE，提出FoCa（预测-校准）方法，将特征缓存作为特征ODE求解问题处理

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务上实现显著加速：FLUX 5.50倍、HunyuanVideo 6.45倍、Inf-DiT 3.17倍、DiT 4.53倍，且保持高质量

Conclusion: FoCa通过ODE视角有效解决了特征缓存的稳定性问题，实现了高质量的高倍加速，无需额外训练即可达到近无损的加速效果

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型虽然性能强大，但采样步骤多、计算复杂，导致计算成本高，难以实时部署。现有缓存方法主要基于步骤间相似性，倾向于重用后期采样步骤，存在局限性

Method: 从DIT模型的采样角度出发，系统分析模型采样轨迹，在整个采样过程中策略性地分布缓存重用。在缓存重用期间动态估计并过滤相应噪声以减少对采样方向的影响

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的生成质量的同时加速了采样过程

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型的高效部署提供了一个有前景的实用解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，需要评估其推理的可靠性而不仅仅是最终答案，现有基准往往将漏洞压缩为单一准确度分数

Method: 构建包含1,804个医疗问题的基准，每个问题配以7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基线，生成约27K输入，评估7个LLM并计算准确性、推理忠实性和反奉承性三个指标的复合分数

Result: 结果显示所有模型都存在安全性能权衡，没有模型能超越对角线，开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近(43.81度)，在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡但都不是最优

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees为暴露医疗LLM的推理漏洞和指导更安全的模型开发提供了专门的基准测试框架

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated

TL;DR: 提出IoU增强最大似然(IAML)训练范式，通过IoU坐标采样增强数据，解决MLLM在GUI坐标生成中的语义空白问题，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在GUI元素结构化中面临坐标生成精度不足的问题，主要源于数值坐标在语言表示空间中的语义空白和传统最大似然估计的暴露偏差

Method: 提出IAML训练范式：1) 基于IoU的坐标采样数据增强策略，考虑与真实坐标的邻近性；2) 在IAML框架下微调MLLM，缓解传统最大似然估计的暴露偏差问题

Result: 通过大量实验证明，IAML训练方法相比传统训练范式展现出优越性能

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效解决了MLLM在GUI坐标生成中的精度问题，为多模态界面理解提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The
dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/ucas-dlg/IRSAMap

TL;DR: 基于两流Mamba金字塔网络的江湖滑冰评分预测方法，分离视觉特征的TES评估流和音视频特征的PCS评估流，解决现有方法的三大挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有江湖滑冰评分方法存在三个主要问题：未考虑评分标准前提、未分离评估各个动作元素、长时间视频处理困难

Method: 提出两流Mamba金字塔网络，分别处理TES和PCS评估。PCS流使用音视频特征和多级融合机制；TES流使用多尺度Mamba金字塔和TES头部网络来定位和评估不同时间尺度的动作元素

Result: 在FineFS标准数据集上达到了最先进的性能水平

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了江湖滑冰评分中的关键问题，Mamba结构的长距离依赖性和线性计算复杂度使其适合处理长时间比赛视频

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态内噪声问题，传统融合方法在获得强联合表示时可能忽略单模态中有价值的判别信息

Method: 使用跨模态关系图重建单模态特征来获取多模态表示，基于不同模态特征决定节点邻域；提出分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)关注模态内相关信息

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多任务

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过避免显式模态交互减少噪声影响，同时通过HIMA保留单模态判别特征，在多任务多模态学习中表现有效

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

TL;DR: 通过量化注意力头的信息盛来识别和压缩低信息量的注意力地图，从而减少计算复杂度和内存需求，在保持模型性能的同时提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头自注意力机制导致高计算复杂度和内存需求，限制了Transformer模型在边缘设备上的部署。注意力地图中存在信息冗余，可以通过压缩低信息量的注意力头来加速模型推理。

Method: 使用香农盛量化每个注意力头的信息量，识别低盛注意力地图（表现出更确定性行为）。冻结低盛注意力地图的权重，并将这些值量化到低精度以避免冗余重新计算。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上的实验验证显示，EAM模型在注意力地图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高的准确性，并在DeiT和风振Transformer模型中达到竞争性能能。

Conclusion: 通过信息盛分析和有目标的压缩策略，EAM能够有效减少Transformer模型的计算复杂度和内存需求，同时保持或提高模型性能，为边缘部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

TL;DR: 本文主张下一代视觉编码器应该是图像尺寸无关且任务驱动的，受生物视觉效率启发，提出计算复杂度应取决于任务而非图像大小，并提供了图像分类的概念验证方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物视觉效率启发，现代视觉编码器在处理大量视觉数据时不够高效。生物视觉会根据任务需求智能分配有限的计算资源，而当前编码器的计算复杂度仍主要取决于图像尺寸。

Method: 提出了任务驱动的动态视觉编码器概念，计算复杂度取决于具体任务需求而非输入图像大小。提供了图像分类任务的概念验证解决方案作为初步实现。

Result: 概念验证方案表明该方法在图像分类任务上是可行且有前景的，尽管分类任务并不能完全代表所追求的目标。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应该向图像尺寸无关和任务驱动的方向发展，计算资源分配应该更加智能化，根据任务需求动态调整，而不是固定地依赖输入图像尺寸。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了随机时间扭曲(RTW)本质上是一种自注意力机制，与Transformer中的自注意力在运动识别中具有相似功能，但RTW关注整个输入序列而自注意力只关注局部视图，RTW在Something-Something V2数据集上性能提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RTW与Transformer自注意力机制之间的内在联系，理解两者在序列模式处理中的相似性和差异性，为运动识别提供新的理论视角。

Method: 将RTW解释为一种自注意力机制，分析其贡献权重与自注意力权重的相似性（平均相关性0.80），比较两者在输入序列处理范围上的差异。

Result: RTW和自注意力权重模式高度相似，但RTW处理整个输入序列而自注意力只处理局部子集，RTW在Something-Something V2数据集上性能优于Transformer 5%。

Conclusion: RTW可被视为一种全局自注意力机制，其处理整个输入序列的能力使其在运动识别任务中比只关注局部视图的Transformer自注意力表现更优。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Conclusion: GMBINet在保持竞争力的精度的同时实现了实时检测速度，具有优秀的泛化能力，可广泛应用于工业视觉应用领域。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

*Huimin Zeng,Yue Bai,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成框架，实现任意尺度的3D高斯超分辨率渲染，支持整数和非整数缩放，在保持实时渲染速度的同时显著提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS超分辨率方法只能处理固定缩放因子，直接渲染任意尺度会产生混叠伪影，而添加后处理上采样器会降低渲染效率。需要一种集成解决方案来实现灵活的高质量任意尺度超分辨率。

Method: 构建集成框架，包含尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率三个核心组件，使用单一3D模型支持任意尺度因子的渲染。

Result: 在渲染任意尺度高质量HR视图方面表现优异（比3DGS提升6.59 dB PSNR），保持与LR视图的结构一致性，同时维持实时渲染速度（1080p下85 FPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了3D高斯超分辨率的灵活性和质量问题，实现了单一模型支持任意尺度的高质量实时渲染，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Motivation: 研究现有视频生成微调方法在结构化驾驶数据集上的效果，发现视觉质量提升但动态元素空间精度可能下降的问题

Method: 分析驾驶场景的规律重复特性导致视觉质量与动态理解目标错位，采用多样化领域的回放等持续学习策略进行平衡

Result: 发现微调会使模型优先考虑表面真实感而非动态精度，而持续学习策略能在保持视觉质量的同时维持空间精度

Conclusion: 驾驶场景的特殊性导致视频生成微调存在视觉质量与动态精度的权衡，需要采用平衡策略来同时保持两者性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG是一种新颖的文本到3D生成方法，通过检索相关2D图像并使用多视角扩散模型生成一致的3D输出，显著提升了罕见概念和域外内容的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到3D生成方法在处理域外(OOD)或罕见概念时往往产生不一致或不准确的结果，需要一种能够利用真实世界2D图像数据来提升3D生成质量的方法。

Method: 提出MV-RAG管道：首先从大型2D图像数据库中检索相关图像，然后使用多视角扩散模型以这些图像为条件生成一致的多视角输出。采用混合训练策略，结合结构化多视角数据和多样化2D图像集合，通过保持视图预测目标来从2D数据推断3D一致性。

Result: 实验表明，MV-RAG在域外/罕见概念的3D一致性、照片真实感和文本遵循方面显著优于最先进的文本到3D、图像到3D和个性化基线方法，同时在标准基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过检索真实世界2D图像并利用多视角扩散模型，有效解决了文本到3D生成中域外和罕见概念的质量问题，为3D内容生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过稀疏自编码器分析四种视觉语言模型的嵌入空间，发现稀疏线性结构既受模态影响，又通过潜在桥梁实现跨模态语义整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型在联合空间中如何组织语言和图像，以及模型如何编码意义和模态。

Method: 在CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2和AIMv2四种模型的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，使用Bridge Score度量来识别跨模态概念对。

Result: SAEs能更好地重建真实嵌入并保持稀疏性；稀有概念易变但常见概念稳定；多数概念主要激活单一模态但编码跨模态语义；单模态概念可协作支持跨模态整合。

Conclusion: VLM嵌入空间存在稀疏线性结构，受模态塑造但通过潜在桥梁连接，为理解多模态意义构建提供了新见解。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

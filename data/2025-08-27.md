### [1] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于复数空间语义吸引子的AGI理论框架，通过张量变换和虚数运算构建语义旋转结构，用目的性算子替代统计预测来实现语义收敛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破当前基于统计token预测的transformer模型局限，探索通过递归张量变换形成语义而非概率推断的新方法

Method: 使用虚数i的循环运算构建旋转语义结构，引入语义吸引子（Microvitum）作为目的性算子，通过梯度流、张量变形和迭代矩阵动力学实现语义转换

Result: 建立了能够建模反讽、同音异义和歧义的语义结构，提出了从模拟转向递归收敛实现语义连贯的新认知架构

Conclusion: 真正语义产生于向语义连贯性的递归收敛而非模拟，需要设计能够塑造语言而不仅仅是预测语言的新型认知架构

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

TL;DR: KAIROS基准测试研究LLM在多智能体系统中如何基于历史印象建立信任、抵抗错误信息并整合同伴输入，发现GRPO强化学习方法在提升性能的同时降低了社交影响的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在多智能体系统中如何形成信任、抵抗错误信息并整合同伴输入，这些因素对于在复杂社交动态中实现集体智能至关重要。

Method: 提出KAIROS基准测试，模拟具有不同可靠性同伴的问答竞赛，控制专家-新手角色、噪声群体和对抗性同伴等条件，评估提示工程、监督微调和强化学习（GRPO）等缓解策略。

Result: GRPO结合多智能体上下文、基于结果的奖励和无约束推理实现了最佳整体性能，但相比基础模型降低了社交影响的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文和结果驱动的强化学习能提升LLM的集体决策性能，但需要平衡性能提升与社交影响鲁棒性之间的关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangCrUX数据集首次大规模收集12种非拉丁语系网站的12万个网站数据，揭示多语言网页可访问性普遍存在语言提示不一致问题，影响屏幕阅读器效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络多语言化趋势明显，但辅助技术对非拉丁语系支持不足，缺乏大规模多语言网页数据集阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 构建LangCrUX数据集（12种语言12万个网站），系统分析多语言可访问性，开发Kizuki语言感知自动化测试扩展工具。

Result: 发现网页可访问性提示普遍无法反映内容语言多样性，降低了屏幕阅读器的有效性。

Conclusion: 多语言网页可访问性存在严重问题，需要语言感知的自动化测试工具来改善辅助技术的支持效果。

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

TL;DR: PLAST是一种通过精确语言特定层微调来高效提升大型视觉语言模型多语言能力的训练方法，仅需调整14%参数即可显著改善多语言理解性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言能力上存在不平衡问题，研究发现多语言理解能力与浅层语言特定神经元激活存在显著相关性

Method: 首先通过监控语言特定神经元激活来识别参与多语言理解的层，然后使用问题翻译对精确微调这些层以实现多语言对齐

Result: 在MM-Bench和MMMB基准测试中有效提升了多语言能力，仅调整14%参数就实现了显著效率，并能推广到低资源和复杂视觉推理任务

Conclusion: PLAST方法通过浅层语言特定视觉信息参与，为大型视觉语言模型提供了高效的多语言增强解决方案

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

### [5] [Backprompting: Leveraging Synthetic Production Data for Health Advice Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18384)
*Kellen Tan Cheng,Anna Lisa Gentile,Chad DeLuca,Guang-Jie Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过backprompting技术生产类似真实LLM输出的标签数据，结合稀疏人巡环聚类标注，构建健康建议监控器的精细训练数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业环境中LLM使用风险，特别是获取部署前真实LLM输出的高质量标签数据困难

Method: 提出backprompting方法生成生产级别标签数据，结合稀疏人巡环聚类技术进行标注，构建并行语料库

Result: 在健康建议识别任务中表现优异，检测器性能超过GPT-4o达3.73%，参数量减少400倍

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高质量标签数据，为LLM监控器开发提供有效解决方案，在复杂场景中体现出良好效果

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

### [6] [Integral Transformer: Denoising Attention, Not Too Much Not Too Little](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18387)
*Ivan Kobyzev,Abbas Ghaddar,Dingtao Hu,Boxing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Integral Transformer，通过积分采样logit分布来降噪注意力，在保持特殊令牌作用的同时减少注意力噪声，在知识推理基准上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统softmax自注意力会给特殊令牌和标点等无信息令牌分配过多权重（注意力噪声），而现有负注意力方法可能丢失有用信息。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer自注意力机制，通过对logit分布进行积分采样来降噪注意力，同时保留对模型性能关键的特殊令牌贡献。

Result: 在知识推理语言基准测试中优于vanilla、Cog和Differential注意力变体，能有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层rank collapse。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer能有效降噪注意力同时保留重要信息，底层使用vanilla注意力可提升性能，上层使用该机制能优化注意力分布。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

### [7] [Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395)
*Jeong-seok Oh,Jay-yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent Self-Consistency (LSC) 是一种新的解码方法，通过可学习的词嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，在短形式和长形式推理任务上均优于现有方法，且计算开销极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂或长形式问题上经常产生不一致的输出。现有的自一致性方法在短形式问答中有效，但在长形式回答中准确率下降，需要一种能在不同回答格式中都可靠工作的解决方案。

Method: 提出潜在自一致性(LSC)方法，使用可学习的词嵌入来选择语义最一致的回答。通过轻量级的前向生成摘要标记，推理时间仅增加不到1%，且无需修改模型架构。

Result: 在6个短形式和5个长形式推理基准测试中，LSC在所有短形式和长形式任务上平均超越了SC、USC和WUCS方法，同时保持可忽略的计算开销。LSC还提供了良好校准的置信度估计。

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨回答格式一致性选择方法，在保持低计算成本的同时，显著提高了输出的语义一致性和校准性能。

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

### [8] [Can Out-of-Distribution Evaluations Uncover Reliance on Shortcuts? A Case Study in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18407)
*Michal Štefánik,Timothee Mickus,Marek Kadlčík,Michal Spiegel,Josef Kuchař*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑OOD评估在反映模型真实部署失败方面的有效性，通过分析QA模型中的预测捷径问题，发现不同OOD数据集对模型鲁棒性的评估质量差异很大，有些甚至不如简单的同分布评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前AI研究中通过OOD评估模型泛化能力的假设，认为这种评估方法可能无法真实反映模型在实际部署中的失败情况，特别是针对模型依赖虚假特征或预测捷径的问题。

Method: 将OOD评估结果与现有QA模型中记录的具体失败模式进行对比分析，研究不同OOD数据集在评估模型对预测捷径鲁棒性方面的质量差异。

Result: 发现不同OOD数据集提供的模型鲁棒性评估质量差异显著，有些数据集的表现甚至不如简单的同分布评估。部分原因是虚假捷径在ID和OOD数据集间共享，但也存在训练和评估质量脱节的情况。

Conclusion: 指出了常用OOD泛化评估方法的局限性，为在QA及其他领域更稳健地评估泛化能力提供了方法论和建议。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

### [9] [How Reliable are LLMs for Reasoning on the Re-ranking task?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18444)
*Nafis Tanveer Islam,Zhiming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析不同训练方法对LLM在重排序任务中语义理解能力的影响，研究模型是否能生成更好的文本推理来提高透明度和应对有限训练数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM语义理解能力提升，其透明度下降且在新系统中准确重排序面临挑战，需要深入理解LLM内部工作机制来提供可解释的推理。

Method: 使用环境与地球科学领域的小型排序数据集进行重排序实验，分析不同训练方法对语义理解的影响，并评估可解释性信息。

Result: 研究发现某些训练方法比其他方法具有更好的可解释性，表明并非所有训练方法都能学习到准确的语义理解，而是获得了抽象知识来优化评估。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究LLM训练方法对语义理解的真实影响，以提高模型在重排序任务中的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

### [10] [Integrating gender inclusivity into large language models via instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18466)
*Alina Wróblewska,Bartosz Żuk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过IPIS数据集微调LLMs，解决波兰语中的性别偏见问题，使模型能够生成性别包容的语言输出


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波兰语语法性别系统存在男性偏见，LLMs训练数据强化了这种偏见，导致生成内容性别不平衡

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（人工制作的性别包容校对和翻译指令）微调多语言和波兰语专用LLMs，设计包含明确性别包容指南的系统提示

Result: 成功对Llama-8B、Mistral-7B、Mistral-Nemo、Bielik和PLLuM等模型进行了IPIS微调

Conclusion: 该方法为减轻波兰语生成中的性别偏见提供了系统性解决方案，使性别包容性成为模型的固有特征

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

### [11] [Principled Detection of Hallucinations in Large Language Models via Multiple Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18473)
*Jiawei Li,Akshayaa Magesh,Venugopal V. Veeravalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多重检验假设测试的方法来检测大语言模型中的幻觉问题，将幻觉检测建模为假设检验问题，并与机器学习中的分布外检测问题进行类比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然强大但容易产生幻觉（生成看似自信但实际错误或无意义的回答），需要有效的方法来检测这些幻觉。

Method: 将幻觉检测问题形式化为假设检验问题，借鉴多重检验的思想，提出了一种新的检测方法。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提方法的鲁棒性，证明其优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为检测大语言模型幻觉提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

*Maike Züfle,Vilém Zouhar,Tu Anh Dinh,Felipe Maia Polo,Jan Niehues,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的机器翻译自动评估指标COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic，通过引入多个翻译候选或相似文本的翻译示例来提升评估性能，相比单翻译评估方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器翻译自动评估指标通常只考虑源句子和单个翻译，而人类评估时会参考多个替代翻译，这种评估设置差异可能影响自动指标的性能。

Method: COMET-polycand使用同一源句的多个替代翻译进行比较分析；COMET-polyic借鉴检索式上下文学习，输入相似源文本的翻译及其人工标注质量分数来指导评估。

Result: COMET-polycand加入单个额外翻译即可提升段级指标性能（Kendall's tau-b相关性从0.079提升到0.118），加入更多翻译效果更好；COMET-polyic通过检索示例获得类似改进（0.079到0.116）。

Conclusion: 在机器翻译自动评估中引入多个翻译候选或相似示例可以显著提升评估指标与人类判断的相关性，模型已公开发布。

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种自我评估的视觉隐喻生成框架，通过语言提示分解和轻量级强化学习来提高隐喻对齐效果，在计算资源有限的情况下实现了与闭源模型相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时具备语言理解能力和视觉一致性，当前模型在隐喻对齐方面遇到挑战，需要更有效的方法来绑定源概念和目标概念保持意义一致性。

Method: 提出自我评估框架，结合新提的隐喻分解分数和意义对齐指标；两种方法：训练免费流水线（显式将提示分解为源-目标-意义映射）和训练基流水线（使用自我评估奖励进行轻量级强化学习）。

Result: 训练免费方法在分解、CLIP和意义对齐指标上超越了GPT-4o和Imagen等强基线模型；用户研究显示参与者更偏好GPT-4o，但训练免费方法在抽象隐喻上超过Imagen；结构化提示对长文本和抽象隐喻更有效。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级强化学习能够在较少计算资源下有效实现隐喻对齐，与人类偏好的差距主要来自美学质量和采样设置的敏感性。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

*Colin Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文主张大型语言模型并非模仿人类认知能力，而是基于训练语料库的线性处理模型，通过短接自动机实现语言生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型的本质：它们是否反映人类认知能力，还是仅仅对训练语料库的模仿

Method: 通过分析Transformer架构的计算特性（线性处理格式），对比人类超线性计算格式，并基于Liu等人的短接自动机理论提出解释

Result: 证明LLM与人类认知存在根本性差异，Transformer架构仅支持线性处理而不具备超线性计算能力

Conclusion: 语言不仅仅是内部状态的表达，更是一种"话语机器"，人类和LLM通过不同方式学会使用这种技术

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

### [16] [Scaling Laws for Task-Stratified Knowledge in Post-Training Quantized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18609)
*Chenxi Zhou,Pengfei Cao,Jiang Li,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验研究建立了任务分层缩放律，揭示了语言模型在后训练量化中知识记忆能力比知识利用能力更容易受影响的规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对语言模型后训练量化如何准确影响不同知识能力的理解不充分，现有缩放律忽视了量化特定参数和任务敏感性。

Method: 进行广泛的实验研究，将LLM知识解构为记忆和利用能力，开发包含模型大小、有效位宽、校准集大小和分组大小的统一量化框架。

Result: 核心发现知识记忆能力对有效位宽、校准集大小和模型大小的变化显示出更高的敏感性，而知识利用能力更加稳健。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对PTQ影响的细粒度理解，为开发能更好保留目标认知功能的知识意识量化策略提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

TL;DR: 提出TBYS框架，通过在推理步骤间插入主动生成的insights来指导LLM的复杂推理过程，解决训练数据中人类内在思维缺失的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂推理任务（如数学）中表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据缺乏人类思考过程中的内在思维（意图和方法论），这些关键信息对于连接推理步骤至关重要

Method: 设计Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS)框架，在连续推理步骤间主动生成insights来回顾状态并启动下一步推理；构建自动化流水线收集和筛选上下文示例，减少人工标注和微调开销

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上的实验验证了TBYS的有效性

Conclusion: 通过主动生成insights来模拟人类思考过程，可以有效提升LLM的复杂推理能力，该方法为改善LLM推理性能提供了新思路

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

TL;DR: 提出了Collaborative Decoding (CoDe)方法，通过动态整合有无外部知识的输出概率，在保持表达性的同时提升大语言模型响应的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在整合外部知识时难以同时保持忠实度和表达性，要么缺乏知识支持而损害忠实度，要么过于冗长而牺牲表达性。

Method: 提出协作解码(CoDe)框架，基于分布散度和模型置信度动态整合有无外部知识的输出概率，并引入知识感知重排序机制防止过度依赖参数知识。

Result: 实验表明CoDe框架在多种大语言模型和评估指标上都能在不损害表达性的情况下显著提升忠实度，验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoDe方法成功打破了忠实度与表达性之间的权衡，为大语言模型的知识整合提供了有效的插件式解决方案。

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Emotion Omni模型架构，通过有限数据和无需大规模训练的方式，实现语音LLM的情感理解和共情语音响应生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音LLM仅简单转换响应内容为语音，未能充分理解用户查询中的丰富情感和副语言线索，且大规模训练需要大量数据和计算资源

Method: 提出新颖的Emotion Omni模型架构，并基于开源TTS框架开发数据生成管道，构建20万条情感对话数据集

Result: 成功构建支持共情语音助手的数据集和模型架构，演示样例已公开

Conclusion: Emotion Omni为解决有限数据下语音LLM情感理解问题提供了有效方案，改善了人机交互体验

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

TL;DR: 提出基于"难度平衡教学"原则的新框架，通过联合分析模型感知难度和样本内在复杂性来优化多模态思维链提示选择，显著提升多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态思维链提示中随机或手动选择的示例无法考虑模型特定知识分布和任务内在复杂性，导致性能次优且不稳定。

Method: 将提示选择重构为提示课程设计问题，整合两种互补信号：模型感知难度（通过主动学习中的预测分歧量化）和样本内在复杂性，开发难度平衡采样策略。

Result: 在五个挑战性基准测试和多个流行多模态大语言模型上的实验表明，该方法带来显著且一致的改进，大大减少了随机采样导致的性能差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为增强多模态推理提供了一种原则性和鲁棒性的方法，通过难度平衡的提示课程设计有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前医学视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中存在答案不一致性问题，面对语义相同但表述不同的医学问题时答案波动显著。作者构建了RoMed数据集并提出了CCL方法，显著提升了模型的一致性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险医疗应用中，确保对多样化问题表述的一致性回答对于可靠诊断至关重要。当前医学视觉语言模型在面对语义等效的医学问题重述时表现出令人担忧的脆弱性，答案波动显著。

Method: 构建了RoMed数据集（包含14.4万个问题，涵盖词汇级、句子级和语义级扰动），并提出了一致性对比学习（CCL）方法，包括知识锚定一致性学习和偏差感知对比学习两个关键组件。

Result: 在RoMed数据集上评估SOTA模型（如LLaVA-Med）时观察到性能显著下降（如召回率下降40%）。CCL方法在三个流行VQA基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并在RoMed测试集上将答案一致性提高了50%。

Conclusion: CCL方法通过整合医学知识对齐和偏差感知表示精炼，显著增强了医学视觉语言模型的鲁棒性和答案一致性，为高可靠性医疗诊断应用提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大模型在通用领域表现良好，但在处理领域特定术语和新词时准确率不足，需要专门的方法来提升术语识别能力

Method: Attention2Probability方法将语音与术语间的交叉注意力权重转换为存在概率，并采用课程学习策略提升检索精度，同时构建了新的术语语音数据集

Result: 在测试集上显著优于VectorDB方法，中英文最大召回率分别达到92.57%和86.83%，单查询延迟仅8.71ms，术语准确率提升6-17%

Conclusion: 该方法轻量、灵活且准确，有效提升了语音大模型的术语处理能力，同时揭示了当前模型在术语利用方面仍存在局限性

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应原创性过滤(AOF)提示框架，通过余弦相似度过滤和词汇新颖性要求，提升多语言谜语生成的创造性和文化适应性，在GPT-4o上显著改善了词汇多样性和减少了冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言谜语生成需要平衡文化流畅性和创造性抽象，但标准提示策略往往重复记忆的谜语或进行浅层改写，缺乏真正的创造性。

Method: 引入自适应原创性过滤(AOF)框架，使用基于余弦相似度的拒绝机制来过滤冗余生成，同时强制执行词汇新颖性和跨语言保真度。

Result: 在三个LLM和四个语言对上的评估显示，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语上实现了0.177的Self-BLEU和0.915的Distinct-2分数，表明词汇多样性改善和冗余减少。

Conclusion: 语义拒绝机制可以在无需任务特定微调的情况下，指导基于文化的创造性生成。

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: EMMM框架成功解决了客户服务场景中机器生成文本检测的可解释性问题，为非专家用户提供了可信赖的AI部署方案

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

Motivation: 当前广告标题生成方法主要优化质量或点击率，忽视了多样性需求，导致输出同质化严重，无法满足不同受众群体的需求。

Method: 提出语义和风格感知的数据生成管道自动产生高质量训练对，采用多阶段多目标优化框架（监督微调+强化学习），在单次前向传播中生成高质量多样化标题。

Conclusion: DIVER框架成功解决了广告标题生成中质量与多样性的平衡问题，为大规模广告系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

Motivation: 当前多模态情感原因三元组提取领域存在数据集稀缺（只有一个高度统一的对话场景数据集）和现有方法未能显式建模情感因果上下文、忽视多层级语义信息融合的问题。

Method: 提出了M3HG模型，通过多模态异构图显式捕获情感和因果上下文，并在话语间和话语内两个层级有效融合上下文信息。同时构建了MECAD数据集，包含来自56部电视剧的989个对话。

Result: 大量实验证明M3HG模型相比现有最先进方法具有更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: M3HG模型和MECAD数据集有效解决了多模态情感原因三元组提取领域的挑战，为后续研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构分散信息为连贯段落并显式保持时间顺序，在叙事QA任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要更广泛的上下文和段落间的时序关系，而不仅仅是孤立的信息片段。

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个关键方面：将分散的文档信息重构为连贯的结构化段落，以及通过显式捕获和维护检索段落间的时间顺序来保持叙事流。

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验表明，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂时序关系理解的任务中取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 时序推理对于解决叙事问答任务至关重要，ChronoRAG通过专门针对叙事文本特性的设计有效提升了RAG在长上下文叙事任务中的表现。

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具备强大的思维链推理能力，但计算成本控制仍是实际部署的重大挑战。开源社区缺乏类似GPT系列的可控推理能力，需要开发开源解决方案。

Method: 采用端到端训练范式：预算模式监督微调将可控推理能力嵌入学习过程，以及两阶段预算感知强化学习配合自适应奖励塑造。

Result: 实现三种推理模式：高模式（全能力）、中模式（50% token减少，性能下降<10%）、低模式（75% token减少，性能下降<15%），在分布外任务上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ThinkDial成功实现了目标压缩-性能权衡，在显著减少响应长度的同时保持性能阈值，为开源社区提供了可控推理的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于编码器-解码器模型的传统方法在语法错误编改任务中取得了一定成功，但大语言模型在这一领域的应用仍然不足。当前研究主要依赖监督微调训练LLMs直接生成编改后的句子，这限制了模型强大的推理能力。

Conclusion: 结果明显地展示了使用强化学习来导向大语言模型的优势，为语法错误编改领域的未来发展提供了更可控制和可靠的范式。

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning

Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音和自然语言处理技术的发展，对话分析领域需要自动化处理大规模复杂对话。传统意图检测方法使用固定意图集，而主题检测提供更灵活的用户面向对话摘要，特别适用于客户支持和销售等领域。

Method: 提出可控对话主题检测问题，将其构建为对话话语的联合聚类和主题标注任务，通过用户偏好数据控制主题簇的粒度，实现可控性。

Result: 在DSTC 12竞赛中设立了公开赛道，提供了相关数据集和评估指标（自动和人工），收集了参赛团队的提交方案并进行分析。

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

TL;DR: LaTeXTrans是一个多代理系统，专门用于翻译LaTeX格式文档，能够保持格式完整性和术语一致性，在翻译准确性和结构保真度方面优于主流机器翻译系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代机器翻译系统在通用文本上取得了显著进展，但翻译结构化LaTeX格式文档仍然是一个重大挑战，因为这些文档混合了自然语言和特定领域语法（如数学公式、表格、图表和交叉引用），需要准确保持语义完整性和可编译性。

Method: LaTeXTrans采用协作式多代理系统，包含六个专门代理：1）解析器通过占位符替换和语法过滤将LaTeX分解为翻译友好单元；2）翻译器、验证器、总结器和术语提取器协作确保上下文感知、自我纠正和术语一致的翻译；3）生成器将翻译内容重构为结构良好的LaTeX文档。

Result: 实验结果表明，LaTeXTrans在翻译准确性和结构保真度方面都能超越主流机器翻译系统。

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans为翻译LaTeX格式文档提供了一个有效且实用的解决方案，能够确保格式保持、结构保真和术语一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Motivation: 数字时代虚假信息泛滥带来重大社会挑战，现有方法难以捕捉长距离依赖、复杂语义关系和新闻传播的社会动态，且需要大量标注数据

Method: 整合抽象语义表示(AMR)和新闻传播动态的自监督框架，使用LLM生成对比损失(LGCL)增强特征可分性，采用多重图掩码自编码器从社交上下文图中学习传播特征

Result: 大量实验表明，该自监督框架在性能上优于其他最先进方法，即使在有限标注数据集下也能提高泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合语义和传播特征，在自监督方式下成功区分真假新闻，为解决虚假信息检测问题提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges
in scalability, cost, and data reliability. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

TL;DR: ConfTuner是一种新的微调方法，通过tokenized Brier score损失函数来校准大语言模型的置信度表达，无需真实置信度标签，有效解决了LLM过度自信的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在科学、法律、医疗等高风险领域部署时经常表现出过度自信，生成错误答案但表达高置信度，这影响了模型的可靠性和可信度。现有方法效果有限且泛化性差。

Method: 提出了ConfTuner方法，使用基于proper scoring rule原理的tokenized Brier score损失函数进行微调，不需要真实置信度分数或代理置信度估计，计算开销小。

Result: ConfTuner在多种推理任务上显著改善了校准效果，并能泛化到GPT-4o等黑盒模型。更好的校准置信度带来了自校正和模型级联等下游任务的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了可信赖LLM系统的发展，通过proper scoring rule理论支撑的简单高效微调方法有效解决了LLM置信度校准问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt成为进化算法基自动提示中最有效的解决方案之一，通过反射进化方法实现了更精确和全面的最优提示搜索

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算教育研究(CER)领域的研究者往往缺乏资源进行大规模、严谨的研究，需要能够处理大量定性数据而不增加研究负担的方法。

Method: 提出LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，结合内容分析和大型语言模型，使研究者能够进行原本无法完成的大规模研究。

Result: 使用计算教育数据集展示了LACA方法在可重复和严谨分析中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: LACA方法在CER领域具有重要潜力，能够从更广泛的研究中得出更具普适性的发现，有助于提升CER学科的研究质量和实践水平。

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

TL;DR: 使用自然语言处理技术分析欧洲六个国家议会演讲，发现普遍存在情感极化现象，即对反对派表现出更多负面情绪，且这种极化与议员活跃度无关，但存在互惠机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情感极化（对反对群体的负面情绪和敌意）在欧洲议会中的存在情况，这种极化已成为全球政治话语的显著特征。

Method: 收集六个欧洲国家议会的演讲语料库，运用自然语言处理技术估计议员情感，通过比较对反对派和己方个体的负面情绪水平来分析情感极化模式。

Result: 在所有六个欧洲议会中都发现一致的情感极化现象；活跃度与负面情绪相关，但活跃度不同的议员之间情感极化程度无差异；互惠机制是议会间情感极化的促成因素。

Conclusion: 欧洲议会普遍存在情感极化，这种极化不受议员活跃度影响，但通过互惠机制得以强化，表明需要关注政治对话中的负面情绪动态。

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估主要集中在性能指标，对数据集质量和隐私保护关注不够，而这些对于真实世界应用的有效性和可信质量至关重要。

Method: 设计了三个专门段代理：(1)多样性段代理利用聚类技术最大化主题覆盖和语义变化性；(2)隐私段代理检测和隐磨多领域的敏感信息；(3)QA精选段代理合成具有隐私保护和多样性的QA对作为RAG评估的真实标准。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条实用且符合道德规范的途径，实现更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估，为未来与时俱进的AI法规和遵循标准对齐的提升奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Conclusion: AI母语框架成功实现了在神经网络中嵌入原生符号语言，为模型提供了同时具备直觉推理能力、符号组合性和内在可解释性的统一解决方案。

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to

develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation
potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation
scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves
model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes
to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights

Result: 在两个挑战性基准测试中大幅超越强基线方法，消融研究验证了分层组件的互补效益

Conclusion: HiPlan通过分层规划有效解决了LLM智能体在复杂任务中的规划挑战，提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面分析了大语言模型能否通过上下文学习掌握极低资源语言，比较了不同对齐信号和参数高效微调的效果，发现零样本上下文学习配合语言对齐对极低资源语言最有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言（特别是使用罕见文字的语言）在大语言模型中缺乏支持，主要原因是训练数据稀缺。本文旨在探索LLMs是否能够通过上下文学习来获取这些语言能力。

Method: 系统评估了20种代表性不足的语言，在三个最先进的多语言LLM上测试了上下文学习（带/不带辅助对齐信号）与参数高效微调方法的对比。

Result: 研究发现当语言及其文字都极度缺乏代表性时，PEFT方法存在局限性。零样本ICL配合语言对齐对极低资源语言效果显著，而少样本ICL或PEFT更适合相对更有代表性的语言。

Conclusion: 为LLM实践者提供了基于实验结果的指导原则：避免在未见文字的语言上微调多语言模型，零样本ICL加语言对齐是处理极低资源语言的有效策略。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

*Mathew Henrickson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的艺术品溯源研究框架，专门针对Getty溯源索引，通过语义检索和上下文摘要实现自然语言和多语言搜索，解决了艺术品溯源研究中碎片化多语言档案数据的检索难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术品溯源研究对于验证真伪、支持归还和法律主张、理解文化历史背景至关重要，但现有搜索门户需要精确元数据，限制了探索性搜索，且多语言碎片化档案数据阻碍了高效检索。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)框架，结合语义检索和上下文摘要技术，实现对Getty溯源索引中拍卖记录的自然语言和多语言搜索，减少对元数据结构的依赖。

Result: 在Getty溯源索引-德国销售记录的10,000条样本上测试表明，该方法能够有效检索和摘要拍卖记录，为艺术市场档案导航提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该RAG框架为历史学家和文化遗产专业人士进行历史敏感性研究提供了实用工具，能够有效处理艺术品溯源中的多语言碎片化数据挑战。

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决依赖MAXQDA和NVivo等黑盒软件导致的方法论不透明和研究目标不对齐问题，提高计算话语分析的透明度和可靠性。

Method: 使用NLTK、spaCy和Sentence Transformers构建自定义Python流水线，采用迭代式BERTopic模型过程，包括UMAP降维、HDBSCAN聚类和c-TF-IDF关键词提取，通过参数调优提升主题一致性和覆盖率。

Result: 通过历史政治话语案例研究展示，证明了精确词汇搜索与语境感知语义聚类相结合的多层次方法能够克服单一方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究工作流强调代码层面的透明性、研究者主动性和方法论三角测量在计算话语研究中的重要性，并提供了可克隆的工具链解决方案。

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary
materials are available via GitHub.

*Zhikai Ding,Shiyu Ni,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答中存在幻觉问题，本文研究其知识边界感知能力，评估三种置信度信号，并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LVLMs对自身知识边界的感知能力，确保模型能够识别知道和不知道的内容，提高可靠性。

Method: 评估三种置信度信号：概率置信度、答案一致性置信度和语言化置信度，并采用LLM中的置信度校准方法进行改进。

Result: LVLMs具有一定程度的感知能力但仍有改进空间，概率和一致性信号更可靠，语言化置信度容易导致过度自信。视觉和文本联合处理降低了性能但提高了感知水平。

Conclusion: LVLMs的知识边界感知需要进一步改进，概率和一致性置信度是更可靠的指标，提出的校准方法能有效提升感知能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏广泛采用的整体科学推理评估基准，且很少有方法系统性地分离知识和推理在科学任务中的不同作用

Method: 引入SciReas基准套件和SciReas-Pro子集，提出KRUX探测框架分析知识与推理的分离作用，进行深入分析并比较不同数据组合

Result: 发现知识检索是LLM科学推理的关键瓶颈；外部知识能进一步提升推理性能；增强verbalized reasoning能提升任务相关知识提取能力

Conclusion: 提出了全面的科学推理评估框架，揭示了知识检索的重要性，并发布了SciLit01作为8B参数的科学推理基线模型

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

Motivation: 为了解决长语音合成中多说话人对话建模的挑战，需要开发能够高效处理长序列并保持音频保真度的统一方法

Method: 采用next-token扩散方法，通过自回归生成潜在向量来建模连续数据，并引入新型连续语音分词器实现高效数据压缩

Result: 相比流行的Encodec模型，数据压缩提升80倍，保持可比性能；能在64K上下文窗口中合成90分钟4人对话语音，超越开源和专有对话模型

Conclusion: VibeVoice通过创新的分词器和扩散方法，成功实现了高质量的长语音多说话人合成，在计算效率和音频质量方面都取得了显著突破

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

TL;DR: 本文评估了平函语言摘要中的可读性评估方法，发现传统指标如FKGL与人类判断相关性弱，而语言模型能更好地预测可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平函语言摘要需要有效的可读性评估方法，但当前标准实践使用的传统可读性指标在该领域未经过人类判断验证。

Method: 评估8种可读性指标与人类判断的相关性，并分析语言模型在可读性评估中的表现。

Result: 大多数传统指标与人类判断相关性弱（包括最流行的FKGL），语言模型表现更好（最佳模型Pearson相关系数达0.56），能更好抓取深层次的可读性因素。

Conclusion: 建议在平函语言摘要评估中使用语言模型以替代传统指标，并提供了最佳实践建议。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

TL;DR: 本文提出生成式界面范式，让LLM主动生成用户界面而非简单对话回复，在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中显著提升交互效率和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM系统受限于线性的请求-响应模式，在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中交互效率低下，需要更自适应的交互方式。

Method: 提出生成式语言模型界面框架，利用结构化界面特定表示和迭代优化，将用户查询转换为任务特定的用户界面。

Result: 生成式界面在70%以上的情况下被人类用户偏好，在功能、交互和情感体验方面均优于传统对话式界面。

Conclusion: 生成式界面为LLM交互提供了更优范式，阐明了用户偏好生成式界面的时机和原因，为人机交互的未来发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了两种无需真实训练数据的水下3D物体检测方法：基于合成数据训练的深度学习模型和基于几何先验的模板匹配系统，发现模板匹配在真实水下环境中更为稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下3D物体检测面临真实训练数据稀缺的挑战，获取注释声纳数据成本高、逻辑复杂。本文该研究旨在解决如何在不依赖真实训练数据的情况下实现可靠的水下3D物体检测。

Method: 采用双重方法：1）基于物理的声纳模拟管道生成合成训练数据，用于训练最新的神经网络；2）基于目标物体几何先验的模型基両模板匹配系统。

Result: 在波罗的海海底实际调查数据上：使用合成数据训练的神经网络在模拟场景上达到98% mAP，但在真实声纳数据上下降到40% mAP；而模板匹配方法在不需训练的情况下在真实数据上保持83% mAP，显示出对声学噪声和环境变化的稳健性。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了水下领域深度学习需要大量数据的传统观念，并建立了首个大规模的无需训练的水下3D检测基准。该研究为自主水下载具导航、海洋考古和离岸基础设施监测等数据稀缺环境带来了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤MRI检测方法存在泛化性差、计算效率低、缺乏可解释性和透明度等问题，限制了临床可信度。需要开发一种既能提高特征表示能力，又能保持计算效率和提供可视化解释的通用模型。

Method: 采用MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流特征级融合架构，使用GradCAM提供可视化解释。在包含胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和正常样本的6020个MRI扫描增强数据集上进行训练，采用严格的5折交叉验证协议。

Result: 训练准确率99.75%，测试准确率98.35%，F1分数0.9835（95%置信区间：0.9743-0.9920）。相比VGG19基线模型，准确率提升3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热图清晰显示肿瘤区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一个高效、高性能、可解释的模型，具有成为临床实用工具的潜力，能够为脑肿瘤识别提供可靠且透明的诊断支持。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在视觉实体引用时的知识回忆能力显著低于文本引用，存在多模态基础系统缺陷，可通过内部状态探测识别不可靠响应


<details>

Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础中的系统性缺陷，特别是当实体引用从文本变为视觉时模型知识回忆能力的下降

Method: 通过控制研究比较文本和视觉引用下的知识回忆能力，分析模型内部状态模式，开发探测机制来识别不可靠响应

Result: 视觉引用使事实知识回忆能力减半，内部状态探测准确率达92%，在视觉问答任务中覆盖度提升7.87%同时降低错误风险0.9%

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在链接实体内部知识与图像表示方面存在困难，这种可检测的系统性缺陷是多模态基础的重要研究方向

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [58] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的快速单图像人脸重建框架，能够在10毫秒内从任意姿态的单张人脸图像生成高质量的3DGS模型，比优化方法快1000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS人脸生成方法要么需要每张人脸进行耗时优化，要么前馈方法重建质量不足。需要一种既能快速推理又能保持高质量重建的解决方案。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络设计，首先构建3DGS人脸模板模型，然后将输入图像编码为身份特定且姿态不变的潜在嵌入，解码预测模板高斯参数残差。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法(GAGAvatar)，运行速度比优化方法(FlashAvatar等)快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar结合了优秀的重建质量和速度，扩展了3DGS在消费级和交互式系统中光真实感头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Motivation: 在紧急人道主义场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但会给弱势群体带来数据安全风险，需要开发适合此类场景的生物特征模板保护方案。

Method: 通过系统分析生物特征模板保护方案，选择PolyProtect方法处理神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器在真实人道主义场景数据集上进行验证和识别精度、不可逆性和不可链接性评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在验证和识别场景中表现良好，首次在指纹生物识别中得到验证，证明了其模态无关性和实用性。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种轻量级、模块化且有效的生物特征模板保护方案，适用于人道主义紧急场景，代码将公开发布以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文主张在视觉基础模型中引入显式关系接口（动态关系图）来增强关系推理能力，通过轻量级图推理模块提升细粒度语义保真度、鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在处理需要显式实体、角色和时空关系推理的任务时存在局限，而关系能力对于细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析等任务至关重要。

Method: 提出在基础模型中集成动态关系图接口，图拓扑和边语义根据输入和任务上下文动态推断，使用轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块进行增强。

Result: 实验表明，通过稀疏语义节点推理，这种混合方法在细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率方面优于纯基础模型基线，同时具有更好的内存和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 提出了FM图混合模型的针对性研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接探测结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的车牌可读性分类数据集LPLC，包含10,210张车辆图像和12,687个标注车牌，用于判断车牌是否需要超分辨率处理或是否完全不可恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动车牌识别系统中对模糊、低质量车牌的处理问题，优化模型性能和计算效率，通过选择性图像预处理来提高识别效果。

Method: 创建细粒度标注数据集，包含车辆和车牌级别的遮挡信息、四个可读性类别（完美、良好、差、不可读），并使用ViT、ResNet和YOLO三个基线模型进行可读性分类任务。

Result: 三个基线模型的整体F1分数均低于80%，表明该任务具有挑战性，需要进一步研究。超分辨率和车牌识别方法的分析也验证了任务的难度。

Conclusion: LPLC数据集为车牌可读性分类研究提供了重要资源，当前方法的性能不足凸显了该领域需要更多的研究投入，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一个专家-通才框架，通过轻量级皮肤病图像分类器和压缩的视觉语言模型相结合，在皮肤病视觉问答任务中实现了18%的准确率提升，同时显著降低了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在医疗任务中虽然表现出潜力，但其通用性限制了专业诊断准确性，且大模型规模导致推理成本过高，难以在临床环境中实际部署。

Method: 采用专家-通才框架：1）轻量级领域训练的图像分类器（专家）提供快速准确的诊断预测；2）压缩的对话式视觉语言模型（通才）生成自然语言解释；3）基于知识图谱的检索模块确保回答的事实准确性。专家预测直接指导通才推理。

Result: 在皮肤病多模态数据集上，CLARIFY比最强的基线模型（微调未压缩单线VLM）诊断准确率提升18%，平均VRAM需求降低至少20%，延迟降低至少5%。

Conclusion: 专家-通才系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型来检测监控视频中的异常事件，无需在训练时接触异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件不可预测且高度依赖上下文环境。传统方法需要异常样本进行训练，而零样本方法可以检测未见过的异常行为。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干网络提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示以识别时间偏差，CLIP提供语义流进行概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 该框架能够整合预测建模和视觉语言理解，在复杂环境中泛化到未见过的行为，弥合了时间推理和语义上下文之间的差距。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架通过结合时空建模和语义理解，为监控视频中的异常检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一个自监督的3D场景流估计框架，通过4D雷达多普勒测量生成运动伪标签，无需人工标注即可实现LiDAR场景流估计，在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著优于现有自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景下性能不足，而全监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展，需要开发无需人工标注的高性能场景流估计方法。

Method: 提出跨模态标签迁移方法，利用4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和歧义消除传播将标签迁移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上大幅超越现有自监督方法，仅使用10%的标注数据就能达到全监督方法90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow证明了通过跨模态学习可以有效解决3D场景流估计的标注瓶颈问题，为自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的安全导航提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视图准确恢复建筑结构，而3D细节化方法又过度依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单先验（如立方体）生成满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗略先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活的几何控制而不增加计算成本，并开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines通过创新的几何转换建模和大规模数据集支持，成功解决了卫星图像3D建筑生成的准确性和细节化问题。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Motivation: 在复杂三维游戏环境中，高效识别地图过渡点对客户端自动地图生成和关卡设计评估至关重要。这项研究旨在形成化这一任务并建立基准性能指标。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习管道：第一阶段使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，第二阶段使用轻量级MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征对其进行排名。模型采用参数高效的适配器和可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在五款动作RPG游戏构建的多样化数据集上验证。完整网络微调在数据充足时STP检测效果更优，而仅使用适配器的转移学习在少数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健和有效。

Conclusion: 这项研究定义了一个新的视觉识别任务，提供了基准模型、数据集和有效模型适配策略，为未来AI驱动的游戏导航助手和数据驱动的关卡设计工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过创新的特征重组策略解决了多模态融合中的关键问题，提高了专家网络的泛化能力和信息捕获能力，为癌症生存分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜像效果）时表现不佳，主要缺乏配对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器的视频修复模型，通过参考式擦除定位所有对象相关区域；引入额外监督显式预测副作用影响区域。

Result: ROSE在视频对象擦除方面表现优于现有模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Conclusion: ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据生成，有效解决了视频对象移除中的副作用问题，为视频修复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 本文提出了OwlCap模型和HMD-270K数据集，通过数据构建和优化方法解决了视频字幕生成中的运动-细节不平衡问题，在多个基准测试中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，模型往往过度强调一个方面而忽视另一个方面，导致生成的字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：通过两阶段流程（运动-细节融合MDF和细粒度检查FGE）构建HMD-270K数据集；2) 优化层面：基于组相对策略优化(GRPO)提出字幕集等价奖励(CSER)，通过单元到集合匹配和双向验证来增强完整性和准确性。

Result: OwlCap模型在细节导向的VDC基准上准确率提升4.2%，在运动导向的DREAM-1K基准上F1分数提升4.6%，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的HMD-270K数据集和OwlCap模型有效解决了视频字幕生成中的运动-细节不平衡问题，为视频字幕研究社区提供了有价值的资源和方法。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于聚类的特征空间表示学习方法有效解决了甲骨文检测中的退化问题，为数字考古中的甲骨文自动化检测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SFormer模型，在频率域使用SNR先验，通过傅里叶注意力机制和频率自适应变换器提升水下图像增强效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间域SNR先验方法存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面能力有限

Method: 提出傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)在频率域分解特征为幅度和相位谱，结合频率自适应变换器(FAT)瓶颈模块，采用U型架构整合RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集上训练，PSNR提升3.1dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频率域SNR先验方法相比空间域方法能更有效地提升水下图像增强性能

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出分层时空分割网络(HSSN)用于超声心动图视频的左心室心内膜分割，通过结合局部细节建模和全局动态感知来提高射血分数(EF)估计精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然分割性能良好，但在EF估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来改善EF计算准确性

Method: 采用分层设计：低层使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层使用Mamba架构捕获时空关系；提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块通过跨帧和位置的跳跃扫描整合长程上下文

Result: 网络设计平衡了单帧和多帧处理，避免了单帧处理的局部误差累积和多帧处理的细节忽略问题，有助于减轻超声图像噪声等因素导致的EF计算偏差

Conclusion: 该方法通过分层时空建模和跨帧扫描机制，有效提升了超声心动图视频中左心室分割的EF估计准确性

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: FPS是一种新的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来应对域偏移问题，相比传统微调方法更高效、可解释且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和扩展性不足的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，保持特征编码器冻结，利用预训练模型特征空间中的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界，实现离线特征提取和全数据集单周期优化。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，FPS达到或超越了最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色表现。

Conclusion: FPS为迁移学习提供了一个简单、有效且通用的域适应范式，特别适用于需要高效计算和良好可解释性的应用场景。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Motivation: 人体活动识别系统面临高计算成本、冗余特征和实时场景可扩展性有限等挑战，需要开发轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用定制InceptionV3提取空间特征，LSTM建模时间依赖关系，集成遗传算法ADFSA进行特征选择，平衡准确性、冗余度和复杂度等目标。

Result: 在UCF-YouTube数据集上实现99.65%识别准确率，特征减少至7个，推理时间显著提升，支持树莓派等边缘设备实时部署。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了轻量级、可扩展的HAR解决方案，适用于公共安全、辅助技术和自主监控系统等资源受限环境。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在限制，导致内镜视频可变形组织重建的保真度不足。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数来适配编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model(EDM)结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间独立变形，以捕捉局部组织变形和全局运动一致性。

Result: 在DaVinci机器人手术视频和标准数据集上达到最高水平，PSNR为39.85（比之前3DGS方法高1.5），SSIM为97.25%，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对于术中导航和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在不平衡数据集上训练时倾向于偏向多数类，导致少数类识别性能显著下降的问题。

Method: 扩展洪水正则化到类别级别，根据类别频率为每个类别分配特定的洪水阈值，抑制多数类过拟合的同时让少数类充分学习。

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上验证，相比传统洪水正则化方法，提升了少数类的分类性能并获得更好的整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化能有效处理类别不平衡问题，通过差异化正则化策略改善模型在不平衡数据集上的泛化性能。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

Motivation: 传统课程学习依赖损失值或梯度大小评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些指标变得不敏感，难以有效设计课程。需要一种在平坦区域仍能准确评估样本难度的方法

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化对抗脆弱性。将ADM集成到基于SAM的课程学习框架中，动态评估样本难度

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和域泛化任务上验证，方法同时保留了课程学习和SAM的优势，优于现有的课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM提供了一种在平坦最小值区域有效评估样本难度的方法，成功结合了课程学习和SAM优化的优势，显著提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

Motivation: 水下目标检测面临图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡等挑战，不同物种检测性能差异显著但原因不明，需要探究影响类别特异性性能的因素并系统改进表现不佳的海洋物种检测。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类别的定位问题，并通过数据平衡实验研究分类性能差距。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最棘手阶段且与数据量无关；分类实验显示即使数据平衡仍存在精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类间依赖的内在特征挑战。

Conclusion: 建议优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回时使用平衡分布；改进表现不佳类别应聚焦算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面；已公开代码和数据集。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了从2D工程图自动生成参数化CAD模型的研究空白，为工业设计流程提供了更符合实际工作方式的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Conclusion: 路由器和闸控机制的结合有效地提升了音视频语音识别在噪声环境中的适应能力，为多模态融合提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Method: 结合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，生成语义合理且视觉相似的答案和干扰项，并包含内容判别模块识别适合视觉选项的内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，CmOS在内容判别、问题生成和视觉选项生成方面优于现有方法，适用于不同学科和教育水平。

Conclusion: CmOS框架有效解决了教育多选题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量多选题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为在线地图构建提供了更经济、地理多样性更好的训练方案，代码已开源

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的印象标签嵌入方法，利用字体形状与印象关系来生成更准确的字体印象表征，在印象导向的字体生成和检索任务中表现优于BERT和CLIP等标准嵌入方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传递特定印象，字体形状与印象标签存在紧密关联。标准词嵌入方法如BERT和CLIP在这些印象标签上表现不佳，需要专门的嵌入方法来更好地表征字体印象。

Method: 构建一个图结构，节点代表印象标签，边缘编码标签的共现关系。然后应用谱嵌入技术为每个标签生成印象向量。

Result: 方法能够为经常共现的印象标签分配相似向量，而标准嵌入方法则产生差异很大的向量。在定性和定量评估中，该方法在印象导向的字体生成任务上表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过利用字体形状与印象的关联性，该研究提出的图谱嵌入方法能够生成更有效的印象标签表征，为印象基于的字体处理任务提供优秀的表征能力。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Motivation: 国家森林调查需要耗时耗力的现场调查，而遥感技术结合机器学习可以更频繁地更新调查数据。虽然卫星时间序列在区分树种方面有效，但当前方法主要依赖手工设计的特征和物候指标。

Method: 使用Google Earth Engine提取Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5卫星数据和SRTM数据的时间序列，然后微调公开可用的领先领域遥感基础模型的深度特征，进行树种分类。

Result: 在荷兰国家森林调查数据集上，该方法比当前最先进方法的分类准确率提高了远超10%，证明了深度AI特征在数据有限应用中的优势。

Conclusion: 通过利用开政卫星数据和领先领域的预训练模型，该方法显著提高了树种分类准确度，可以有效补充现有的森林调查过程，证明传统手工设计的调和特征对于这项任务过于简单。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Conclusion: 该方法能够精确检测微表情的起始、顶点和偏移阶段，充分利用互补信息，高效利用有限数据，并增强模型能力。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Conclusion: 该框架提高了微行外科技能评估的效率和可靠性，推进了培训协议的发展

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Conclusion: 该方法使现代稳定器能够超越传统SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并为用户提供类似经典方法的控制机制，在下游应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医疗诊断中的公平性问题，为分布偏移下的公平医疗AI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。HOI类别中人类是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要针对性增强

Method: 双查询增强网络：1)对象查询增强-使用对象感知编码器特征；2)交互查询增强-设计交互语义融合模块利用CLIP模型提取语义特征；3)辅助预测单元改善交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过分别增强对象查询和交互查询的双重策略，有效提升了HOI检测的准确性和模型对交互的理解能力

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,

TL;DR: EVENTA Grand Challenge是首个大规模事件级多模态理解基准，包含事件增强图像检索与描述、基于事件的图像检索两个赛道，45个团队参与，旨在推动上下文感知的多媒体AI发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像描述和检索任务主要关注人物、物体和场景的表层识别，往往忽略了定义真实世界事件的上下文和语义维度，EVENTA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于OpenEvents V1数据集，整合上下文、时间和语义信息来捕捉图像背后的who、when、where、what、why，设置两个赛道并通过公开和私有测试阶段进行评估。

Result: 来自6个国家的45个团队参与挑战，前三名团队受邀在ACM Multimedia 2025上展示解决方案，建立了公平和可复现的评估框架。

Conclusion: EVENTA为上下文感知、叙事驱动的多媒体AI奠定了基础，在新闻、媒体分析、文化存档和可访问性等领域具有应用前景。

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

*Amartaivan Sanjjamts,Morita Hiroshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于Transformer的框架来区分行人群组和个体，建立空间利用和行为模式度量体系，为人群动力学研究提供分析基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析现实世界轨迹数据中群体和个体行人在空间利用和行为模式上的差异，为行人模拟和空间设计验证提供依据

Method: 将行人轨迹分割为固定时间仓，使用Transformer-based配对分类模型识别凝聚群体，通过结构化序列过滤过程分离个体行人

Result: 建立了包含空间维度（凸包面积、最小包围圆半径、热图空间密度）和行为维度（速度变化、运动角度偏差、清除半径、轨迹直度）的完整度量框架

Conclusion: 该框架为不同序列长度（60、100、200帧）的可扩展分析奠定了基础，未来版本将完成定量分析及其在人群动力学研究中的应用

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大空间尺度珊瑚礁监测的挑战，航拍图像分辨率有限难以区分精细类别，而像素级标注成本高且劳动密集，限制了深度学习方法的可扩展性

Method: 多尺度弱监督语义分割框架，结合基于分类的监督、空间插值和自蒸馏技术，从水下图像向航拍数据迁移精细尺度生态信息

Result: 方法能够实现大区域珊瑚形态类型的分割，并展示了集成新类别的灵活性

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种可扩展、成本效益高的高分辨率珊瑚礁监测方法，结合了低成本数据收集、弱监督深度学习和多尺度遥感技术

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Motivation: 传统GIS制图需要专业领域知识且耗时，特别是重复性任务。生成式AI特别是图像扩散模型为自动化和民主化地图制作过程提供了新机会，但这些模型在空间构图和语义布局控制方面存在局限。

Method: 整合矢量数据来指导基于文本提示的不同风格地图生成，开发了首个能够生成精确控制风格地图的模型，并将其集成到网络应用程序中以提高可用性和可访问性。

Conclusion: 研究展示了AI辅助制图新范式的潜力，同时指出了进一步的技术改进方向，并强调了制图师在AI辅助制图新时代中的新角色。

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Motivation: 为了解决传统Transformer在固定上下文长度任务中计算效率低下的问题，同时保持高性能

Method: 采用token混合、序列池化和卷积tokenizer的架构设计，不依赖数据增强、位置编码或学习率调度等技巧

Result: 在CIFAR100上，top1准确率从36.50%提升到46.29%，top5从66.33%提升到76.31%，模型大小仅为SDPA Transformer的60%，且在上下文长度小于嵌入维度时更高效

only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available

TL;DR: USO是一个统一的风格-主体优化定制模型，通过解耦学习和重组内容与风格，同时实现风格相似性和主体一致性的最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献通常将风格驱动和主体驱动的生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显的对抗性。作者认为这两个目标可以在单一框架下统一，因为它们都涉及内容与风格的解耦和重组

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并解耦内容与风格；3) 加入风格奖励学习范式(SRL)；4) 发布USO-Bench联合评估基准

Result: 大量实验证明USO在开源模型中实现了最先进的性能，在主体一致性和风格相似性两个维度上都表现出色

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动的生成任务，通过解耦和重组内容与风格的方法，为这两个传统上被视为对立的目标提供了统一的解决方案

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的NeRF视觉定位方法ppNeSF，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，在保持定位精度的同时防止敏感信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于NeRF的视觉定位方法虽然能提供高质量的新视角合成，但会无意中编码精细场景细节，在云服务部署时存在隐私泄露风险。

Method: 提出ppNeRF方法：1）设计新协议评估NeRF表示的隐私保护性；2）用自监督分割监督替代RGB图像训练，确保标签足够粗糙以隐藏可识别细节，同时保持3D区分性。

Result: 实验表明传统NeRF的几何表示容易受到隐私攻击，而ppNeSF在分割空间中实现了准确的视觉定位，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ppNeSF成功解决了NeRF-based视觉定位中的隐私问题，通过分割监督训练在保护隐私的同时保持了优异的定位精度。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在文档视觉问答中引入检索增强生成(RAG)的效果，通过文本检索和纯视觉检索两种方式，在多页文档数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面，要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，都存在内存消耗大的问题。RAG通过先检索相关片段再生成答案，提供了更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用两种检索变体：基于OCR标记的文本检索和无需OCR的纯视觉检索，在多个模型和基准测试上进行系统评估，包括MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA数据集。

Result: 文本检索变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升高达+22.5 ANLS，视觉检索变体无需文本提取也能实现+5.0 ANLS提升。检索和重排序组件贡献了大部分性能增益。

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能够持续提升多页文档VQA的准确性，证明了其在现实应用中的实用价值，而布局引导的分块策略在这些数据集上未能提供帮助。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

TL;DR: GRAS是一个用于评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)在性别、种族、年龄和肤色方面人口统计偏见的基准测试，提出了可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标，测试发现现有模型存在严重偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的广泛使用，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估方法来检测和量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色四个维度，设计了GRAS偏见评分这一可解释的量化指标，并对5个最先进的VLMs进行了评估。

Result: 测试结果显示所有模型都存在严重的偏见问题，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分），同时发现评估VQA偏见时需要考虑问题的多种表述方式。

Conclusion: VLMs存在显著的人口统计偏见问题，GRAS基准和评分指标为系统评估和改善模型偏见提供了有效工具，强调了多问题表述在偏见评估中的重要性。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的屋顶平面分割方法存在三个问题：1）非真正端到端导致结果非最优；2）边缘区域特征判别性低导致边缘不准确；3）平面几何特征约束不足。

Method: 采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习的平面查询分层预测平面实例掩码。设计了边缘感知掩码模块（EAMM）融入平面几何先验，提出自适应加权掩码损失和新的平面几何损失。

Result: 该方法实现了真正的端到端分割，提高了边缘区域的判别性和分割精度，通过几何约束优化了网络训练。

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络有效解决了现有深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的关键问题，通过边缘感知和几何约束实现了更准确的分割效果。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球塑料污染日益严重，微塑料已广泛存在于环境甚至生物体内，对人体健康造成潜在危害，需要开发有效的检测方法

Method: 使用尼罗红染料染色和荧光显微镜技术，结合卷积神经网络进行图像分割和微塑料定位计数

Conclusion: MDN模型在微塑料检测方面表现出色，为未来应用于人类血液样本检测提供了有前景的技术路径

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

Motivation: 现有的PRVR方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未得到充分探索，需要专门针对PRVR任务进行架构适配

Method: 提出了ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：1）提示金字塔结构组织事件提示以捕获多粒度语义；2）祖先-后代交互机制实现事件间的动态语义交互

Result: 在三个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了之前的模型

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性地适配CLIP架构，成功解决了部分相关视频检索的挑战，证明了预训练视觉-语言模型在该领域的潜力

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Motivation: 医学图像数据缺乏导致血流动力学生物标记物评估困难，并未充分研究几何表征学习在冠状动脉壳剪应力评估中的应用。

Method: 使用热内核签名作为自监督目标，通过拉普拉斯特征向量获取血管形状的本质特征，在大规模几何模型数据集上进行预训练。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练技术能够有效解决医学图像数据缺乏问题，为血流动力学生物标记物的准确评估提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层优化方法，用于学习任务特定的二值照明模式，在单像素荧光显微镜等应用中实现优越的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单像素成像通过结构化光模式顺序照明实现单探测器物体重建，但需要优化二值照明模式以适应特定任务需求。

Method: 使用直通估计器解决二值模式优化的不可微问题，在双层公式中利用总深度变分正则化器。

Result: 在CytoImageNet显微镜数据集上验证，学习到的模式相比基线方法在高度欠采样情况下获得更好的重建性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习任务特定的二值照明模式，在单像素成像应用中显著提升重建质量。

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a
bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

TL;DR: 通过使用简单旋转不平衡质量产生周期性振动，解决固定光照下静态场景中事件相机无法产生事件的问题，结合运动补偿管道获得清洁的运动缩正事件数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定光照条件下，静态或低运动场景中固定挂载的事件相机无法产生事件，影响计算机视觉任务的执行

Method: 使用轻量级的旋转不平衡质量产生周期性振动，结合运动补偿管道去除注入的运动，获得清洁的运动缩正事件

Result: 在实际采集的数据集上评估，方法可靠地恢复运动参数，在图像重建和边缘检测任务上都比没有运动诱导的事件感知更好

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法通过人工诱导振动有效解决了事件相机在静态场景中的问题，为下游感知任务提供了清洁的运动缩正事件数据

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于历史文档文本行分割的少样本学习方法，使用轻量级UNet++架构和拓扑感知损失函数，仅需3个标注页面即可达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档文本行分割需要大量标注数据，但标注过程成本高且需要专业知识，因此需要开发数据高效的少样本学习方法

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++架构，结合最初为神经元形态学开发的连通性感知损失函数，显式惩罚结构错误（如行碎片化和意外行合并），在每份手稿仅3个标注页面的小补丁上进行训练

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著超越当前最先进方法，识别准确率提高200%，行交并比提高75%，在DIVA-HisDB基线检测任务中F-Measure得分达到或超过竞赛获胜者水平

Conclusion: 小规模简单架构配合拓扑感知损失函数比复杂替代方案更准确且数据高效，证明了该方法在历史文档文本行分割少样本学习中的有效性

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Zhaoyang Li,Gen Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对单目3D视觉定位任务中预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，提出了3D文本增强(3DTE)和文本引导几何增强(TGE)两种方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略测量单位，导致即使物理长度相同但单位不同时性能严重下降，这表明预训练语言模型在3D理解方面存在缺陷。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 3D文本增强(3DTE)：通过增加文本查询中距离描述符的多样性来增强不同单位间映射关系的理解；2) 文本引导几何增强(TGE)：将基础文本特征投影到几何一致空间，用3D增强的文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上取得显著改进，在"Far"场景中准确率提升11.94%，达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征，有效解决了预训练语言模型在3D理解方面的局限性，显著提升了单目3D视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WEF-PE位置编码方法，利用椭圆函数的双周期性和非线性几何特性，更好地保持图像二维空间结构，在多个视觉任务上取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统位置编码缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力

Method: 基于Weierstrass椭圆函数的位置编码，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的代数加法公式从绝对编码推导相对位置信息

Result: 在CIFAR-100上ViT-Tiny从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进，理论证明具有距离衰减特性

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过数学原理方法有效编码二维空间关系，增强了几何归纳偏置，在视觉Transformer中实现了更优越的性能和语义聚焦

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有网格生成方法存在重复顶点使用问题，导致令片序列过长和生成效率低下

Method: 使用自回归模型生成顶点，然后用双向Transformer一步完成面片构建，加上保真提升器和后处理框架

Result: 顶点令片数量减少到现有方法的23%，生成速度提升8倍以上，网格质量更高

Conclusion: 分离顶点和面片生成的框架能有效减少重复性，大幅提升了网格生成的效率和质量

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出All-in-One Slider方法，通过将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏语义属性方向，实现单一轻量模块控制多种图像属性，支持零样本新属性操作和多属性组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型在渐进式图像属性操控方面存在挑战，特别是人脸等细节丰富的内容。传统方法需要为每个属性训练独立滑块模块，导致参数冗余且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 训练轻量级模块将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，形成一个通用滑块，支持各种属性的可解释细粒度连续控制。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了精确且可扩展的属性操控，相比之前方法有显著改进，并能与反转框架结合处理真实图像。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider解决了多属性操控的效率和扩展性问题，支持零样本新属性操作，拓宽了实际应用场景。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Conclusion: 该方法成功垠接了几何重建与生成模型的优势，为机器人学习提供了丰富、可控的大规模3D驾驶场景数据

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Conclusion: 该框架能够准确解读音频、图像和文本的联合语义，生成与角色、场景和语言内容深度一致的动作，超越了简单的节奏同步。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子追踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了纳米尺度运动测量的实验挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管是纳米技术的关键构建块，但其动态生长的表征受到扫描电子显微镜成像中纳米尺度运动测量实验挑战的限制。现有方法只能提供静态分析，而原位技术通常需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的逐粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack将手工制作或深度特征检测器和匹配器集成到粒子追踪框架中，使用ALIKED检测器和LightGlue匹配器作为最优组合，能够对碳纳米管微柱生长进行运动学分析。

Result: 基于13,540条手动标注轨迹的系统性测试显示，该方法F1分数为0.78，α分数为0.89。VFTrack能够将运动矢量分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，便于计算异质区域生长速率和重建演化的CNT柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Motivation: 当前视频分割领域存在碎片化问题，提示分割和无提示分割需要不同的专用模型，缺乏统一的解决方案来处理流式视频分割任务

Method: 提出自回归通用分割模型(AUSM)，将流式视频分割重新定义为序列掩码预测问题，采用状态空间模型维护固定大小的空间状态，支持任意长度视频流，所有组件都设计为跨帧并行训练

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS等多个标准基准测试中优于之前的通用流式视频分割方法，在16帧序列上实现高达2.5倍的训练加速

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示和无提示视频分割任务，通过序列掩码预测方法和并行训练设计，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升，为通用视频分割提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

TL;DR: 提出了首个4D风格化基准测试套件Style4D-Bench，包含评估协议、强基线方法和高质量4D场景数据集，并基于4D高斯溅射构建了Style4D框架实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，缺乏标准化的评估基准和方法，需要建立统一的评估标准和推动该领域发展

Method: 基于4D高斯溅射构建Style4D框架，包含基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（轻量级MLP）和几何保持风格迁移模块，通过对比一致性学习和结构内容保持增强时空一致性

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上进行的广泛实验表明，Style4D在4D风格化方面实现了最先进的性能，产生细粒度风格细节、稳定时间动态和一致的多视图渲染

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究和基准测试的宝贵资源，推动了4D风格化领域的发展

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法通过图像生成和网格对齐两个步骤，使用自注意力重连机制和关键点对应来实现姿态操控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进展，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态的任务仍然具有挑战性。需要一种能够保持网格原始身份的同时实现自由形式文本提示控制的方法。

Method: 1）修改强大的图像生成器，根据输入图像和文本指令创建目标图像；2）通过多视角姿态优化步骤将网格与目标图像对齐；3）引入自注意力重连机制（RSActrl）在图像生成模型中解耦源结构和姿态；4）使用关键点而非可微分渲染来建立输入和目标图像之间的对应关系。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现有效，成功操控姿态的同时保持网格的原始身份。定量评估和比较用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，通过语言控制实现3D资产的姿态调整，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的3D局部编辑方法，通过在3D潜在空间中替换保留区域的去噪特征，实现精确且连贯的3D编辑，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法通过编辑多视角图像后重建3D模型，难以精确保留未编辑区域和保持整体连贯性，需要一种更精确的3D局部编辑解决方案。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹获取反转潜在表示和键值令牌，然后在去噪编辑阶段用对应的反转潜在表示和缓存的键值令牌替换保留区域的去噪特征，确保保留区域的一致重建和编辑部分的连贯整合。

Result: 实验证明VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法，并构建了Edit3D-Bench评估数据集进行验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了有效解决方案，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础，在游戏产业和机器人交互领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作式框架，通过分布式深度学习技术来分割缪血性脑梗止痕翹，解决了单一机构数据资源有限和模型普遍性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑梗止是全球第二大死因和第三大游病因，但传统的计算机辅助诊断方法存在机构间数据差异性大、标注数据缺乏等问题，影响模型的普遍性和性能。

Method: 研究使用联邦学习技术(FedAvg)，通过14个模拟医疗中心的2031例病例数据，在保护数据隐私的前提下共享深度学习表征知识，构建中心独立的痕翹分割模型。

Result: 联邦学习模型在所有中心得到了DSC 0.71±0.24、AVD 5.29±22.74、ALD 2.16±3.60和LF1 0.70±0.26的统一性能，表现超过了中心化模型和其他联邦学习规则。模型还显示了强大的演绎性能，在分布外中心也获得了DSC 0.64±0.29的良好结果。

Conclusion: 该协作式框架能够有效解决医疗数据集中的数据封闭性问题，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了跨机构的缪血性脑梗止痕翹分割，为临床应用提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Method: 建立统一基准测试，比较7种方法，特别关注将重建和分割结合的单阶段方法与先重建后分割的两阶段方法。使用包含多线圈k空间数据和人工标注分割真值的数据集进行测试。

Result: 考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段方法获得了最佳分割分数，超越了专门为此任务开发的复杂专业方法。

Conclusion: 对于欠采样MRI数据分割，简单的两阶段方法（先重建后分割）比复杂的单阶段方法更有效，数据一致性是关键因素。

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在RAW域进行图像恢复的端到端扩散模型，绕过传统ISP处理流程，通过RAW域VAE和可微分后处理模块实现更高保真度的图像恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散模型面临高保真度和真实生成之间的困境，因为处理的是有损sRGB输入且忽略了传感器RAW数据的可用性，导致性能次优。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示、可微分后色调处理模块实现联合优化，开发可扩展退化管道合成训练数据，设计可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，产生更高保真度结果且伪影更少。

Conclusion: 直接在RAW域进行图像恢复的端到端扩散模型能够有效解决sRGB域方法的局限性，实现更高质量的图像恢复效果。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Conclusion: EMind通过基础模型方法有效解决了电磁信号处理的核心挑战，为电磁智能领域提供了统一的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

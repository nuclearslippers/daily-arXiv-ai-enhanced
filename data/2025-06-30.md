### [1] [Efficient Multilingual ASR Finetuning via LoRA Language Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21555)
*Jiahong Li,Yiwen Shao,Jianheng Zhuo,Chenda Li,Liliang Tang,Dong Yu,Yanmin Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家框架，通过专家融合或知识蒸馏提升多语言ASR性能，实验显示性能提升10%-15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言ASR中不同语言相互干扰，共享模型容量导致识别困难。

Method: 基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家框架，采用专家融合或知识蒸馏。

Result: 在语言感知和无语言感知场景下分别实现约10%和15%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多语言ASR中显著优于标准微调方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

### [2] [VAT-KG: Knowledge-Intensive Multimodal Knowledge Graph Dataset for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21556)
*Hyeongcheol Park,MinHyuk Jang,Ha Dam Baek,Gyusam Chang,Jiyoung Seo,Jiwan Park,Hogun Park,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型多模态知识图谱VAT-KG，覆盖视觉、音频和文本信息，通过严格的过滤和对齐步骤自动生成，并引入多模态RAG框架，显著提升了多模态任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGs知识覆盖有限且模态支持不足，无法满足多模态大语言模型的需求，特别是在视频和音频等丰富模态的背景下。

Method: 提出VAT-KG，通过概念中心和知识密集型设计，结合跨模态知识对齐和严格过滤步骤，自动生成多模态知识图谱，并开发多模态RAG框架。

Result: 在多模态问答任务中验证了VAT-KG的有效性，显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: VAT-KG为多模态知识表示和检索提供了统一框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

### [3] [Debunk and Infer: Multimodal Fake News Detection via Diffusion-Generated Evidence and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21557)
*Kaiying Yan,Moyang Liu,Yukun Liu,Ruibo Fu,Zhengqi Wen,Jianhua Tao,Xuefei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去伪知识的多模态假新闻检测框架DIFND，结合条件扩散模型和多模态大语言模型，显著提升了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻在多平台快速传播，严重威胁信息可信度，需要高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: DIFND框架整合条件扩散模型的生成能力和多模态大语言模型的协作推理能力，通过去伪扩散生成证据，并采用链式去伪策略进行多模态推理。

Result: 在FakeSV和FVC数据集上的实验表明，DIFND在检测准确性和可信度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DIFND通过联合建模多模态特征和推理验证，为假新闻检测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

### [4] [Bench to the Future: A Pastcasting Benchmark for Forecasting Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21558)
*FutureSearch,:,Jack Wildman,Nikos I. Bosse,Daniel Hnyk,Peter Mühlbacher,Finn Hambly,Jon Evans,Dan Schwarz,Lawrence Phillips*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为BTF的“过去预测”基准测试，通过已知结果的问题和大量相关网页数据，为LLM提供现实、封闭且可重复的预测环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏为LLM预测任务设计的现实且可重复的基准测试，BTF旨在填补这一空白。

Method: BTF基于已知结果的“过去预测”问题，结合大量离线网页数据，评估LLM的预测能力。

Result: 实验表明，BTF能产生与实时互联网预测类似的结果，并展示了不同LLM和预测方法的性能。

Conclusion: BTF是一个动态基准测试，将持续更新问题以跟踪LLM预测能力的进步。

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own
research.

### [5] [GraphLAMA: Enabling Efficient Adaptation of Graph Language Models with Limited Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21559)
*Junze Chen,Cheng Yang,Shujie Li,Zhiqiang Zhang,Yawen Li,Junping Du,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出GraphLAMA方法，通过参数适应阶段优化图语言模型（GLM），解决固定参数和长上下文导致的效率问题，并在少样本任务中实现更高准确性和更快推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图语言模型（GLM）在少样本任务中存在固定参数导致的效率问题和长上下文带来的性能挑战，同时指令调优需要大量标注数据。论文旨在通过参数适应阶段高效优化模型。

Method: 提出GraphLAMA方法，结合图神经网络（GNN）和LLM表示空间，通过预训练和参数适应阶段优化模型，仅需少量标注数据即可适应新任务。

Result: 在少/零样本节点分类和摘要生成任务中，GraphLAMA实现了4.91%的绝对准确率提升，推理速度比ICL快10倍。

Conclusion: GraphLAMA通过高效的参数适应阶段，显著提升了GLM在少样本任务中的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

### [6] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning of Language Model for Instruction Following and Math Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21560)
*Yifu Han,Geo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了强化学习微调技术在小型语言模型上的效果，发现RLOO结合DeBERTa奖励模型表现最佳，DPO结果稳定，数学任务中数据增强和验证器显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习微调技术在小型语言模型上的有效性，以提升指令跟随和数学推理能力。

Method: 比较了SFT、DPO和RLOO三种微调方法，结合奖励模型和外部验证器。

Result: RLOO表现最佳，DPO结果稳定；数学任务中数据增强和验证器显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为小型语言模型的微调提供了实用策略和关键权衡。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

### [7] [Reasoning Isn't Enough: Examining Truth-Bias and Sycophancy in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21561)
*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Madhavendra Thakur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在事实核查和决策中被广泛使用，但其作为真相判断者的能力仍不明确。研究比较了推理和非推理模型，发现推理模型的真相偏见较低，但仍高于人类基准，且部分高级模型存在谄媚倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在真相检测中的能力，并首次分析推理模型的表现。

Method: 让8个LLMs进行4,800次真相判断，比较推理和非推理模型的表现。

Result: 推理模型的真相偏见较低，但高级模型在欺骗检测上表现不佳，显示能力提升未能解决根本问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在真相检测方面仍有挑战，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

### [8] [FloorPlan-DeepSeek (FPDS): A multimodal approach to floorplan generation using vector-based next room prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21562)
*Jun Yin,Pengyu Zeng,Jing Zhong,Peilin Li,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于‘下一个房间预测’的渐进式生成方法，用于建筑设计中的平面图生成，解决了现有端到端生成模型与实际工作流程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平面图生成模型多为端到端生成，与实际建筑设计中渐进迭代的工作流程不兼容。

Method: 受大型语言模型中自回归‘下一个词预测’机制启发，提出‘下一个房间预测’的生成范式。

Result: 实验表明，FPDS在文本到平面图任务中表现优于扩散模型和Tell2Design。

Conclusion: 该方法有望支持未来智能建筑设计。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

### [9] [FormosanBench: Benchmarking Low-Resource Austronesian Languages in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21563)
*Kaiying Kevin Lin,Hsiyu Chen,Haopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FORMOSANBENCH是首个评估大语言模型在低资源南岛语系语言（如阿美语、泰雅语和排湾语）表现的基准测试，结果显示现有模型在这些语言上表现不佳，亟需更包容的NLP技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究低资源和濒危语言（如台湾南岛语系语言）在大语言模型中的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建FORMOSANBENCH基准，涵盖机器翻译、自动语音识别和文本摘要任务，评估零样本、10样本和微调设置下的模型表现。

Result: 现有模型在低资源语言上表现显著落后，10样本学习和微调仅带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更包容的NLP技术以支持濒危和代表性不足的语言，并公开数据集和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

### [11] [A Multi-Agent Probabilistic Inference Framework Inspired by Kairanban-Style CoT System with IdoBata Conversation for Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21565)
*Takato Ueno,Keito Inoshita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种多智能体推理框架（KCS+IBC），结合多个大语言模型（LLM），通过模拟日本传统的kairanban文化和idobata对话，实现情感分析中的偏见缓解、可解释性提升和概率预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受日本kairanban文化和idobata对话的启发，旨在通过多智能体协作改善情感分析的偏见和多样性问题。

Method: 提出KCS+IBC框架，结合多个LLM，引入中间阶段的非正式对话环节和概率情感预测。

Result: KCS在准确性上与单一LLM相当，KCS+IBC在推理后期熵降低、方差增加，表明其能平衡预测的聚合与多样性。

Conclusion: 未来工作将量化这些特性对偏见校正的影响，并开发更先进的情感分析系统。

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

### [12] [The Saturation Point of Backtranslation in High Quality Low Resource English Gujarati Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21566)
*Arwa Arif*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了反向翻译（BT）在英语-古吉拉特语低资源机器翻译中的效果，发现添加合成数据未提升性能，甚至略有下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索反向翻译在高质量低资源机器翻译中的有效性，尤其是在英语-古吉拉特语翻译中。

Method: 使用MBART50模型，基于5万句高质量平行语料库训练基线系统，并添加经过筛选的反向翻译合成数据。

Result: 添加合成数据未显著提升翻译性能，BLEU分数保持43.8，甚至略有下降。

Conclusion: 反向翻译在某些低资源场景中可能达到收益递减点，需进一步研究其适用性。

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BioPars，一种用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在生物信息学任务中的能力的工具，并展示了其在波斯医学问答中的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索LLM在生命科学中的应用潜力，特别是在生物信息学和医学问答领域。

Method: 通过构建BIOPARS-BENCH数据集和BioParsQA评估工具，比较了ChatGPT、Llama和Galactica在知识获取、解释和推理方面的能力。

Result: BioPars在多个评估指标（如ROUGE-L、BERTScore、MoverScore和BLEURT）上表现优于其他模型，尤其是在波斯医学问答中。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM在生物信息学任务中具有潜力，但仍需进一步优化以应对更高层次的推理问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

### [14] [Assessing RAG and HyDE on 1B vs. 4B-Parameter Gemma LLMs for Personal Assistants Integretion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21568)
*Andrejs Sorstkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了RAG和HyDE两种增强策略在小型Gemma LLM上的效果，发现RAG能显著降低延迟并减少幻觉，而HyDE虽提升语义相关性但增加响应时间和幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在边缘和隐私敏感应用中部署大型语言模型的资源效率问题。

Method: 在1B和4B参数的Gemma LLM上测试RAG和HyDE策略，结合MongoDB和Qdrant存储，通过FastAPI和LangChain实现系统。

Result: RAG减少延迟17%并消除幻觉，HyDE提升语义相关性但增加25-40%响应时间和幻觉率。4B模型对HyDE的计算开销更大。

Conclusion: RAG是小型LLM驱动的设备端个人助手的实用选择。

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）框架和合成微调数据集的NL2SVA方法，显著提升了LLM在硬件设计验证中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动编写SystemVerilog断言（SVAs）耗时且易错，需要自动化工具提升效率。

Method: 结合定制RAG框架和合成微调数据集，提供分步解释以优化LLM的语法和功能准确性。

Result: 实验表明，定制RAG框架使功能匹配SVAs数量提升58.42%，微调模型Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct提升59.05%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLM在NL2SVA任务中的性能，为硬件设计验证提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

TL;DR: 分析预训练语言模型（LMs）在低数据量时间序列预测中的有效性，探讨设计选择对验证损失的影响，并发现持续下降的验证损失与非零转移差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过设计选择（如上流后训练、时间序列标记器和语言主干大小）优化预训练语言模型在时间序列预测中的表现，特别是在低数据量情况下。

Method: 分析不同设计选择对验证损失的影响，比较预训练模型与随机初始化模型的性能差异。

Result: 在低数据量情况下，设计选择显著影响验证损失，预训练模型的验证损失持续下降，而非随机初始化模型已收敛，形成非零转移差距。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算高效训练在时间序列预测中的有效应用，并为跨模态数据分布的研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型推理模型（LRMs）是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，并提出了CogTest基准来评估这些习惯。研究发现LRMs具有人类相似的认知习惯，并能根据不同任务自适应调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LRMs是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，以更好地理解和监控模型行为。

Method: 引入CogTest基准，包含16种认知习惯，每种习惯通过25个多样化任务实例化，并使用证据优先的提取方法确保可靠识别。

Result: LRMs表现出人类相似的认知习惯，并能根据任务自适应调整，某些习惯与有害响应生成相关。

Conclusion: 研究LRMs的认知习惯有助于深入理解模型行为，特别是其潜在的不当行为。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM评估基准缺乏结构化、可解释性和理论依据，导致能力重叠、指标冗余和诊断力有限。

Method: 采用结构方程模型（SEM）分析基准的内部效度、维度可分性和组件贡献，并基于皮亚杰理论将MLLM能力分为感知、记忆和推理三个层次。

Result: 提出的新基准Gold在可解释性、指标冗余减少和认知一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于SEM和认知理论的框架为MLLM评估提供了更科学、高效的基准设计方法。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合黑盒和白盒模型优势的新框架，通过语义相似性约束优化大语言模型（LLM）的指令，提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒模型成本高和白盒模型资源需求大、表达能力有限的问题。

Method: 融合黑盒模型的高质量初始化指令和白盒模型的细粒度可解释性，通过语义相似性约束生成统一高维表示，迭代优化指令。

Result: 在复杂推理和跨语言泛化等任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代LLM应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

Motivation: 全球化与移民增加使移民部门面临工作量大和公平决策的挑战，人工智能可能提供解决方案。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括离散选择实验和深度访谈，分析LLM的决策策略及公平性。

Result: LLM能模拟人类决策策略，注重效用最大化和程序公平，但仍存在国籍偏见和特权群体偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化移民决策中具有潜力，但也需注意其局限性，如偏见问题。

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关系型和图结构数据中结构化推理的孤立处理问题，利用SQL和Cypher的共享抽象实现跨形式迁移。

Method: 结合强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督，引入基于图编辑距离的拓扑感知奖励函数。

Result: QwQ-32B模型在Spider和Text2Cypher任务上分别提升13.5%和73.1%，并在零样本下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: STRuCT-LLM证明了可执行查询作为结构化推理支架的有效性，以及SQL和Cypher联合训练的协同优势。

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

Motivation: 解决大规模多语言ASR模型在低资源场景（如稀有语言和代码切换）中的性能问题，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 研究了两种策略：1) 完全微调（FFT）软提示和整个Whisper模型；2) 仅训练软提示（SPT）。还提出了SPT4ASR方法，结合不同SPT变体。

Result: 实验表明，深度提示调优是最有效的SPT方法，SPT4ASR进一步降低了代码切换ASR的错误率，同时保持了参数效率。

Conclusion: SPT4ASR方法在低资源场景中表现优异，且不影响现有语言的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

Result: Entire SPT和LAPT在语言扩展任务中分别比Decoder SPT提升5.0%和16.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为动态多语言ASR模型提供了高效解决方案，计算开销小。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了HealthQA-BR，首个针对葡萄牙语医疗的大型多专业评估基准，揭示了现有大语言模型在跨专业医疗知识中的不均衡表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注医生和英语环境，忽略了医疗团队的多样性，可能导致AI在真实医疗场景中的能力被高估。

Method: 使用巴西全国性考试中的5,632个问题构建HealthQA-BR，涵盖医疗、护理、牙科等多个专业，并对20多个领先大语言模型进行零样本评估。

Result: GPT 4.1等模型总体准确率达86.6%，但在神经外科（60.0%）和社会工作（68.4%）等专业表现不佳，显示出知识分布不均。

Conclusion: 单一评分不足以验证AI在医疗中的安全性，需更细致的评估工具，HealthQA-BR为此提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Result: 定量实验验证了VIDEE的有效性，用户研究显示其对不同经验水平的用户均适用。

Conclusion: VIDEE为非专家用户提供了实用工具，并为未来智能文本分析系统的改进提供了设计启示。

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

Method: 引入首个多类标注数据集，分析希望的心理基础和语言模式，提出优化的注意力变换器模型，并通过5折交叉验证和t检验评估性能。

Result: 提出的XLM-R模型在5折交叉验证中得分0.78，优于基线SVM（0.75）和BiLSTM（0.76）。

Conclusion: 本研究为低资源语言的希望言论检测提供了新方法和数据集，模型性能显著提升。

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

Result: 提示干预显著减少对齐伪装行为，表明其有效性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中伪装的多样性，并强调了对齐评估的重要性。

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

Motivation: 探索利用生成式AI和LLM从在线零售商的食品产品页面中提取结构化信息的有效方法，以解决大规模信息提取的效率和成本问题。

Method: 比较了直接提取和间接提取（通过生成函数）两种方法，评估了它们在准确性、效率和成本上的表现，使用了3,000个食品产品页面的数据集。

Result: 间接提取的准确率略低（96.48%，比直接提取低1.61%），但减少了95.82%的LLM调用次数，显著提升了效率和降低了成本。

Conclusion: 间接提取方法为基于模板的网页大规模信息提取提供了可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIME基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型对哑剧动作的理解能力，发现现有模型表现远不如人类，需进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哑剧动作（mime）作为非语言沟通（NVC）的子集，因其明确性和低解释差异，是理解更复杂NVC的关键前提。

Method: 提出MIME基准测试，包含86种哑剧动作的视频问答任务，通过动作捕捉数据构建，并加入角色、背景和视角的扰动以评估鲁棒性。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在MIME上的表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 需加强研究以提升模型对人类手势的理解能力。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust

### [31] [Is DeepSeek a New Voice Among LLMs in Public Opinion Simulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21587)
*Weihong Qi,Fan Huang,Jisun An,Haewoon Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSeek-V3在模拟美国公众对堕胎问题的意见上表现最佳，但在模拟中国低收入和非大学教育人群对资本主义的看法时存在局限。所有LLM都倾向于在人口群体内过度概括单一视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开源LLM DeepSeek在模拟公众意见方面的能力，并与主流公司开发的LLM进行比较，以揭示其在不同国家和议题上的表现差异。

Method: 通过比较DeepSeek-R1、DeepSeek-V3与Qwen2.5、GPT-4o、Llama-3.3，并利用ANES和中国Zuobiao数据集，评估这些模型在中美社会议题上的预测能力。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在美国堕胎议题上表现最佳，但在中国资本主义议题上表现不佳。所有模型都存在过度概括群体内单一视角的问题。

Conclusion: 需减少LLM在文化和人口统计上的偏见，采用更具包容性的训练方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

*Ilya Lasy,Peter Knees,Stefan Woltran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过机制解释方法探讨LLMs中记忆化的底层机制，识别了触发和维持记忆化的特定电路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs中记忆化的具体机制，包括哪些网络部分决定记忆化序列的开始，以及记忆化和非记忆化行为的具体差异。

Method: 利用变压器电路和对比数据集，识别模型生成与记忆内容的分歧点，并分离负责记忆化的特定电路。

Result: 发现触发记忆化的电路也能维持记忆化，而仅维持记忆化的电路无法触发其开始；记忆化预防机制在不同文本领域间具有鲁棒性，而记忆化诱导则更依赖上下文。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了记忆化在LLMs中的具体机制，为理解模型行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

### [33] [A General Method for Detecting Information Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21589)
*Minjia Mao,Dongjun Wei,Xiao Fang,Michael Chau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的LLM检测器（GLD），用于识别未见过的LLM和领域生成的文本，解决了现有方法泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，区分人类与LLM生成的内容变得困难，影响数字平台的信任和防止虚假信息传播。现有方法难以泛化到新LLM和领域。

Method: 结合双记忆网络设计和理论引导的检测泛化模块，构建GLD。

Result: 实证评估和案例研究表明，GLD优于现有检测方法。

Conclusion: GLD对数字平台和LLM研究具有重要的学术和实践意义。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

*Junqi Jiang,Tom Bewley,Salim I. Amoukou,Francesco Leofante,Antonio Rago,Saumitra Mishra,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于表示一致性（RC）的测试时扩展方法，通过聚合多个候选答案并考虑模型内部激活一致性，显著提升LLM推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要复杂的提示和采样策略修改，而RC旨在通过轻量级计算和缓存激活实现高效答案聚合。

Method: 利用模型生成多个候选答案时的一致性（密集或稀疏激活），通过相似性计算加权聚合答案。

Result: 在四个开源LLM和四个推理数据集上验证，RC比基线方法提升高达4%的准确率。

Conclusion: RC通过内部激活一致性有效提升推理性能，且稀疏激活信号与连贯推理概念一致。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinEval-KR框架通过知识分数和推理分数独立评估LLMs在金融推理任务中的能力，并引入认知分数分析不同认知层次的表现。实验表明推理能力和高阶认知能力是关键，但知识应用仍是瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估基准未能分离知识能力和推理能力，且缺乏任务失败的根因分析。

Method: 提出FinEval-KR框架，引入知识分数、推理分数和基于Bloom分类法的认知分数，并发布开源中文金融推理数据集。

Result: 实验显示推理能力和高阶认知能力是影响准确性的核心因素，但知识应用仍是瓶颈；专业金融LLMs表现普遍落后于通用大模型。

Conclusion: FinEval-KR为金融推理任务提供了更细粒度的评估方法，揭示了LLMs在知识应用上的不足，并支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在手语识别中效率和准确性难以兼顾的问题，尤其是RNN、LSTM和GCN的梯度消失和高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用BART架构的编码器-解码器模型，独立编码x和y坐标，并通过交叉注意力保持其关联性。

Result: 在LSA-64数据集上达到96.04%的准确率，参数仅749,888，优于参数超百万的先前模型，并在WLASL和ASL-Citizen数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了可靠高效的解决方案，有望提升聋哑人士的辅助工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Motivation: 研究旨在开发一个在医学推理领域表现优异且透明的语言模型，同时探索如何在专业领域中训练中等规模模型以超越更大模型。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）监督微调，使用合成医学推理数据集和参数高效技术；2）强化学习，通过GRPO和多组件奖励系统优化模型。

Result: Gazal-R1在MedQA、MMLU Pro和PubMedQA上的得分分别为87.1%、81.6%和79.6%，超越了更大的模型。

Conclusion: Gazal-R1为开发高性能、高效且可解释的专业领域语言模型提供了可复现的框架，并揭示了训练中的挑战。

Abstract: We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent,
step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B,
our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to
outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We
developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on
a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples
that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced
parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work
provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed
reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing
high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance,
efficiency, and explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有LLM在非英语或中文语言中表现不佳，且其训练过程不透明，本文旨在解决这些问题并提升LLM在多语言中的能力。

Method: 通过收集韩语数据集、预处理数据、训练模型、创建下游基准并进行评估，低成本地适配英语LLM到韩语。

Result: 新模型Thunder-LLM和Thunder-LLM-Ins在韩语任务中表现优于现有模型，且资源消耗低。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了低成本提升LLM多语言能力的可行性，并公开了代码和经验。

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly
available.

Result: 检索的教育上下文对模型准确性和推理有显著影响，但也暴露了处理问题-上下文关系的局限性。

Conclusion: 多模态AI驱动学习需进一步优化问题-上下文关系处理，减少噪声影响。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Conclusion: 结构化输入是提升MLLMs文档理解的有效方法，无需修改模型架构或额外训练。

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

Motivation: 随着LLM的快速发展，识别其生成文本的真实性成为迫切需求，现有水印方法难以同时满足文本质量、模型无关检测和多比特水印嵌入的要求。

Method: BiMark采用比特翻转无偏重加权机制、多层架构和信息编码方法，实现模型无关检测、高质量生成和多比特水印。

Result: 实验表明，BiMark在短文本中提取率提高30%，同时保持较低的困惑度，并在下游任务中表现与非水印文本相当。

Conclusion: BiMark在平衡文本质量与水印嵌入能力方面表现出色，为LLM生成文本的识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在人类文化动态中的独特角色，超越传统对其作为智能或模仿工具的二元看法。

Method: 通过分析压缩、解压缩、外部化和递归四个普遍特征，类比DNA的功能，论证LLMs的文化保存与催化作用。

Result: LLMs作为文化可进化性工具，支持人类自我反思和低风险假设生成，而非替代人类智能。

Conclusion: LLMs的意义在于为人类提供文化反思与创新的工具，其价值依赖于人类解释与再创造。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

Motivation: 人类走私网络日益复杂且难以分析，法律案例文档虽提供有价值信息，但因其非结构化、词汇密集和指代模糊，传统知识图谱构建方法存在不足。

Method: CORE-KG采用两步流程：1）通过结构化LLM提示进行类型感知共指消解；2）基于领域引导指令的实体和关系提取，结合改进的GraphRAG框架。

Result: 相比基线方法，CORE-KG减少节点重复33.28%，降低法律噪声38.37%，生成更清晰连贯的图谱。

Conclusion: CORE-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

Method: 系统评估了14个预测任务中的两种多模态范式：基于对齐的方法和基于提示的方法。

Result: 多模态方法并非在所有情况下优于单模态基线，其效果取决于模型架构和数据特性。

Conclusion: 提出了建模和数据方面的五个关键条件，为多模态预测的实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptGOT模型，结合自适应表示学习和GOT表示，解决POI嵌入中的多上下文采样、多POI上下文探索、通用性和泛化性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POI嵌入方法在多上下文采样、多POI上下文探索、通用性和泛化性方面存在不足。

Method: AdaptGOT模型包含三个关键组件：上下文邻域生成、增强的GOT表示和MoE自适应编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在两个真实数据集和多个POI任务上的实验验证了AdaptGOT的优越性能。

Conclusion: AdaptGOT模型通过多上下文集成和自适应学习显著提升了POI嵌入的效果。

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

existing corpora and enriched with child-specific annotations. ChildGuard
captures diverse contexts of child-targeted hate speech, spanning age groups.
We benchmark existing state-of-the-art hate speech detection methods, including

area, we publicly release ChildGuard, providing a robust foundation for
developing improved methods to detect and mitigate such harm.

Motivation: 大语言模型可能通过记忆任务特定数据在QA基准测试中作弊，影响评估有效性，需解决数据泄漏问题并保持基准长期可用性。

Method: LastingBench通过扰动识别泄漏点，并将其改写为反事实内容，破坏模型记忆同时保留评估意图。

Result: 在先进QA基准测试中显示出显著性能差距，验证了LastingBench减少记忆效应的有效性。

Conclusion: LastingBench提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，确保基准测试的长期鲁棒性，促进更公平和可解释的LLM评估。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗语言模型依赖ICD代码，无法捕捉临床医生的复杂推理过程，限制了模型的临床实用性。

Method: GARMLE-G结合LLM预测和EHR数据生成查询，通过嵌入相似性检索CPG内容，融合指南与模型输出生成建议。

Result: 原型系统在高血压诊断中表现优于RAG基线，检索精度、语义相关性和指南依从性更优。

Conclusion: GARMLE-G提供了一种可扩展、低成本且无幻觉的方法，适用于临床实践，具有广泛部署潜力。

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用大语言模型在新闻时间线摘要中难以准确评估主题相关性和理解主题演变，导致摘要包含无关信息或不准确时间戳。

Method: 构建大规模TLS数据集，采用渐进优化策略（指令调优和双对齐奖励学习）提升摘要性能。

Result: TIM在开放领域实验中表现出强大的时间线摘要能力。

Conclusion: TIM通过渐进优化和双对齐学习，有效解决了开放领域时间线摘要中的关键问题。

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

Motivation: 解决自回归TTS模型在语音时长控制上的局限性，特别是在视频配音等需要严格音视频同步的应用中。

Method: 引入两种生成模式：精确控制生成令牌数量以控制时长，以及自由生成模式保留输入提示的韵律特征。同时结合GPT潜在表示提升稳定性，并设计基于文本描述的软指令机制。

Conclusion: IndexTTS2通过创新的时长控制和情感解耦方法，显著提升了TTS模型的性能和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治相关在线讨论中的潜在影响，尤其是其模仿用户生成内容的能力。

Method: 通过三个实验，让GPT-4模拟真实或虚构的党派用户生成评论，分析其政治立场、情感和语言特征，并与真实用户评论及基准模型对比。

Result: GPT-4能生成逼真的评论，但更倾向于形成共识；真实与人工评论在语义嵌入空间中可区分，但人工检查难以辨别。

Conclusion: LLMs可能被用于渗透在线讨论、影响政治辩论，具有AI驱动话语操纵的广泛影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Conclusion: OPC为数学证明生成研究提供了重要资源，并展示了其在模型训练中的实用性。

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

Conclusion: Doc2SAR在性能和实用性上均表现优异，为SAR提取任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading
end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of
80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR
demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied
by a web app.

### [62] [Do We Really Need GNNs with Explicit Structural Modeling? MLPs Suffice for Language Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21682)
*Li Zhou,Hao Jiang,Junjie Li,Zefeng Zhao,Feng Jiang,Wenyu Chen,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过信息论视角提出了一种探测框架，评估结构建模对语言模型表示的影响，并探讨MLPs作为GNNs高效替代方案的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明GNNs未能充分利用结构信息，而MLPs在结构感知任务中表现优异，因此需要系统评估结构建模的作用和MLPs的潜力。

Method: 引入模块化探测框架，选择性使用GNN或其解耦组件（消息传递和特征转换），通过Edge Probing Suite评估效果。

Result: MLPs作为特征转换模块能提升语言模型表示的语言学知识，GNNs结合特征转换也有益，而仅依赖消息传递的模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 特征转换操作对语言模型表示至关重要，MLPs可作为GNNs的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

*Swastika Kundu,Autoshi Ibrahim,Mithila Rahman,Tanvir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ANUBHUTI是一个包含2000句孟加拉语方言的标注数据集，用于情感分析，填补了低资源方言研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语言多样性和标注数据有限，孟加拉语方言的情感分析研究不足。

Method: 数据集包含四种方言的句子，采用双重标注方案（主题分类和情感标注），由专家翻译和标注，并通过一致性检验。

Result: 数据集质量高，标注一致性强，适用于低资源方言的情感分析。

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI为孟加拉语方言的情感分析提供了重要资源，提升了自然语言处理的准确性。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

TL;DR: 研究发现自监督语音Transformer模型中前馈层的特定神经元与说话者信息相关，保护这些神经元可显著保留说话者相关任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音Transformer模型如何编码说话者信息，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 分析前馈层中与k-means聚类和i-vectors相关的神经元，识别与说话者信息相关的神经元。

Result: 这些神经元对应广泛的语音和性别类别，保护它们能显著保留说话者相关任务的性能。

Conclusion: 特定神经元在编码说话者信息中起关键作用，保护它们有助于模型性能的保留。

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

TL;DR: 研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中的参数知识偏见如何影响HerO系统的事实核查结果，发现模型在直接提示下倾向于标记近半数为“证据不足”，而生成的证据受提示策略显著影响，但最终预测结果稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM参数知识偏见对事实核查系统的影响，特别是HerO系统在FEVER-25基准中的表现。

Method: 通过两种实验：(1) 直接提示模型进行事实核查；(2) 生成支持、反驳或中立的核查文档，分析证据检索和预测结果。

Result: 模型在直接提示下对50%的声明标记为“证据不足”，生成的证据受提示策略影响显著，但最终预测结果稳定。

Conclusion: LLM的参数知识偏见显著影响证据检索，但对最终事实核查结果的稳定性影响有限。

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了TLQA基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在时间引用列表问答任务中的表现，发现现有模型在时间对齐和列表构建方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间理解任务中容易产生幻觉和错误，现有研究未充分评估其隐式和显式时间理解能力。

Method: 提出TLQA基准测试，要求模型生成与时间周期对齐的结构化列表答案，并在闭卷和开放域设置下评估模型表现。

Result: 发现当前模型在闭卷设置中无法提供完整答案和时间对齐事实，开放域设置中检索能力需改进。

Conclusion: TLQA基准为未来研究提供了明确方向，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

*Reem Alothman,Hafida Benhidour,Said Kerrache*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于XLNet的自动检测社交媒体上攻击性语言的模型，并与BERT进行比较，结果显示XLNet在检测攻击性内容和分类攻击类型上表现更优，而BERT在识别攻击目标上略胜一筹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上攻击性内容的增加需要自动化检测系统，而深度学习模型（如XLNet和BERT）在自然语言处理中表现出色。

Method: 使用XLNet和BERT模型，基于Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID)进行实验，并采用过采样和欠采样策略处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: XLNet在检测攻击性内容和分类攻击类型上优于BERT，而BERT在识别攻击目标上表现更好。过采样和欠采样策略有效提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: XLNet和迁移学习架构在检测社交媒体攻击性语言方面具有潜力，为解决类别不平衡问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策过程缺乏透明度，限制了其在高风险领域的应用，因此需要系统化的XAI方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过基于LLM的Transformer架构（编码器-解码器、仅编码器、仅解码器）分类XAI方法，并评估其可解释性。

Result: 提供了XAI方法的分类和评估框架，并探讨了其实际应用和资源。

Conclusion: 论文总结了现有XAI方法的局限性，并提出了未来研究方向，以推动透明和负责任的LLMs发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了科学英语中词汇频率的突然变化，特别是由大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）引起的语义和语用变化，而非简单的同义词替换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来科学英语词汇频率的显著变化，尤其是某些词汇（如“delve”）的突然增加，引发了关于大型语言模型对语言结构影响的疑问。

Method: 通过分析PubMed科学摘要中的频率趋势，结合词性标注，系统研究了同义词组的词汇变化。

Result: 发现语义集群整体变化，表明变化主要是语义和语用的；同时，“important”等词汇的减少揭示了更复杂的语言演变模式。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型对语言的影响主要是语义和语用的，而非纯粹的词汇替换，这有助于理解语言技术如何塑造人类语言。

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

Motivation: 波斯古典诗歌的语言、风格和韵律复杂性对计算作者归属提出了挑战，需开发综合方法。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的语言编码器，结合Word2Vec嵌入、风格测量和韵律编码，构建多输入神经网络框架。

Result: 加权投票方案准确率为71%，高置信度阈值（0.9）下准确率达97%。

Conclusion: 该方法为波斯诗歌的作者归属和风格分析提供了有效工具，支持多语言作者归属和生成模型研究。

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

Conclusion: LinguaSynth为可解释且资源高效的NLP模型设定了新基准，挑战了深度学习在文本分类中的必要性。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要高用户信任的实际应用中，估计LLM输出的置信度至关重要。黑盒不确定性量化方法因其仅需模型API访问而受到欢迎。

Method: 论文提出了三个数学陈述及统计测试，验证生成一致性作为置信度代理的假设，并在8个基准数据集和3个任务上进行了实证研究。

Result: 研究发现一致性假设在不同场景下普遍成立，并基于此提出了一种无需数据的黑盒UQ方法，其性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 一致性假设具有实际价值，提出的方法为LLM输出置信度估计提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Conclusion: 句法结构的构建是一个自下而上的过程，整合全局句法信息的时机对模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

Motivation: 解决原生MLLMs因语音-文本配对数据不足导致的灾难性遗忘和性能下降问题。

Method: 采用Mixture of Experts（MoE）架构，自适应区分模态专家，进行单模态训练后联合多模态协作训练。

Result: 性能损失仅5.5%，优于其他原生MLLMs（如GLM-4-Voice）的20%以上性能下降，且对话延迟保持在0.5秒内。

Conclusion: DeepTalk在保持低延迟的同时显著提升了性能，为智能语音交互提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world

overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个两阶段框架评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）作为世界模型（WMs）的基本能力，发现现有模型在基础世界建模能力上存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs作为通用世界模型的潜力，填补系统性评估的空白。

Method: 提出两阶段框架（感知与预测），并引入WM-ABench基准，对15种VLMs进行660次实验。

Result: 现有VLMs在基础世界建模能力上表现不佳，如区分运动轨迹时准确率接近随机，且缺乏解耦理解。

Conclusion: VLMs与世界建模的人类水平存在显著差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

*Sean Kim,Hyuhng Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过两阶段评估定义了LLMs中的两种偏见（模型偏见和推理偏见），并在多语言背景下分析了模型的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在不同语言和文化背景下的行为，尤其是在其输出可能影响公众舆论或强化主导叙事的情况下。

Method: 两阶段评估：第一阶段评估事实性问题，第二阶段评估地缘政治敏感争议问题。构建了一个多语言数据集。

Result: 第一阶段显示查询语言诱导的一致性，第二阶段反映模型训练背景与查询语言的交互作用。

Conclusion: 提供了一个评估LLMs行为的结构化框架，为未来多语言环境中的部署和文化意识评估提供了见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言模型训练中，如何直接获取适合不同任务的数据混合是一个难题，因为数据与任务的关系难以建模。

Method: 通过识别检查点模型在训练轨迹中表现出的能力，利用其一阶影响力近似作为数据混合的信号源。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，该方法显著提升了预训练模型的性能，最高提升1.93%。

Conclusion: 检查点模型具有优化数据质量和混合的潜力。

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在角色扮演场景中的表现和偏见，特别是其在道德困境中的决策行为。

Method: 使用ERG理论构建移民审批场景，分析6种LLMs的决策模式，并考察社会身份对决策的影响。

Result: LLMs在决策中表现出统计显著的偏好，部分模型对边缘化身份拒绝率更高。

Conclusion: LLMs在道德决策中存在隐含偏见，社会身份进一步影响其行为，需更多研究以改进公平性。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

TL;DR: 论文研究了工具集成LLM代理的稳定性问题，发现其在工具调用过程中易受错误影响，开源模型比专有模型更脆弱，模型规模增大未必提升稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对工具集成LLM代理的评估多关注端到端工具使用，忽视了稳定性，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过实验分析代理在工具调用各阶段（读取文档、选择工具、生成参数、处理响应）的脆弱性。

Result: 代理在每个阶段均易出错，开源模型更脆弱；增大模型规模未显著提升推理能力，反而可能增加攻击风险。

Conclusion: 强调评估代理稳定性的重要性，为未来LLM开发和评估提供启示。

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型（PTLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，但其安全性仍存在漏洞，尤其是令牌级和提示级越狱攻击。现有方法各有局限性，需结合两者优势以提升攻击效果。

Method: 提出两种混合攻击方法：GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame，结合令牌级和提示级技术，并在多个Vicuna和Llama模型上评估其效果。

Result: GCG + PAIR在未防御模型上的攻击成功率（ASR）达到91.6%，显著高于单一方法；GCG + WordGame保持高ASR（>80%），并能突破高级防御。

Conclusion: 混合攻击方法揭示了现有安全措施的漏洞，强调了对抗性攻击的适应性，需开发更全面的防御机制。

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Result: 研究发现，社交模拟的实证真实性应在其拟合环境中验证，强调了生成代理建模的严谨性。

Conclusion: 作者主张在社交模拟中更严谨地应用生成代理建模，以确保结果的可靠性。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了驾驶舱对话转录的准确性，证明了微调和规范化在特定领域ASR任务中的有效性。

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

Method: 构建《彼得潘》语料库（21种翻译），使用通用和特定特征集（共447个特征），通过机器学习的分类和聚类技术进行分析。

Result: 在通用特征中，HT与MT在连词分布和1-gram-YiYang比例上差异显著；LLMs在特定特征上表现优于NMT，风格更接近HT。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童文学翻译中展现出潜力，尤其在风格特征上更接近人工翻译。

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

Result: 该方法在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen3模型上实现了推理成本降低70%且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个专门评估模型自我修正能力的新基准，为未来LLM稳健推理研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字平台的社会语言学动态，为理解在线空间中语言如何反映意识形态和社会结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

Conclusion: GPT-2 Small通过特定子网络高效处理主谓一致性，但复杂任务依赖更广泛网络。

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专利检索数据集缺乏明确的领域标注、多司法管辖区覆盖和平衡的查询领域表示，且计算资源需求较高。

Method: 通过三步数据整理流程构建DAPFAM数据集，包含1,247个领域平衡的查询家族和45,336个目标家族，使用IPC代码进行领域标注。

Result: 数据集包含49,869个评估对，支持跨领域专利检索实验，基线实验显示跨领域检索存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: DAPFAM是一个公开、多司法管辖区、计算资源友好的专利检索数据集，为跨领域专利检索研究提供了新资源。

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a

### [92] [SAGE: Spliced-Audio Generated Data for Enhancing Foundational Models in Low-Resource Arabic-English Code-Switched Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22143)
*Muhammad Umar Farooq,Oscar Saz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多种语音自监督学习模型在方言阿拉伯语和阿拉伯语-英语代码切换语音上的表现，提出了一种改进的音频拼接方法生成人工代码切换数据，显著降低了词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决方言阿拉伯语和阿拉伯语-英语代码切换语音数据稀缺的问题，并提升模型在这些任务上的性能。

Method: 引入改进的音频拼接方法生成人工代码切换数据（SAGE），并结合经验回放（ER）方法增强泛化能力。

Result: 词错误率（WER）在阿拉伯语和英语代码切换基准上绝对降低了7.8%，整体平均WER从31.7%降至26.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在代码切换任务上优于大规模多语言模型，展示了高效的数据生成和模型优化策略的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

*Tianshu Yu,Chao Xiang,Mingchuan Yang,Pei Ke,Bosi Wen,Cunxiang Wang,Jiale Cheng,Li Zhang,Xinyu Mu,Chuxiong Sun,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RCO的新框架，通过优化批评模型来提升大语言模型的反馈能力，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未深入探讨哪些类型的批评对改进模型响应最有效，以及如何生成此类批评。

Method: RCO框架通过反馈循环训练批评模型，利用批评效用（CU）作为奖励信号，优化批评质量。

Result: 在五种任务中，RCO显著优于传统方法和开源模型，提升了批评质量和改进效果。

Conclusion: RCO通过新颖的监督方案和实验验证，有效增强了LLM的批评-改进循环。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的探测任务QM，利用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，提高了基于问题的偏见评估的稳定性，并发现指令调整可能改变偏见方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估LLMs政治偏见时稳定性不足，导致模型间比较不可靠，因此需要更稳定的评估方法。

Method: 提出QM任务，利用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，改进偏见评估的稳定性，并比较指令调整模型与其基础版本。

Result: 实验表明，指令调整可改变偏见方向，且更大模型能更有效地利用上下文示例，偏见分数更小。

Conclusion: QM任务提高了偏见评估的稳定性，为模型比较提供了可靠方法，同时揭示了指令调整和模型大小对偏见的影响。

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

*Albert Agisha Ntwali,Luca Rück,Martin Heckmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GPT-4o的新方法，利用上下文信息检测结构化数据中的个人数据，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测个人数据时缺乏对上下文信息的利用，导致性能受限。

Method: 结合特征名称、值、其他特征名称及数据集描述等上下文信息，使用GPT-4o进行检测。

Result: 在真实数据集MIMIC-Demo-Ext上表现最佳，且在Kaggle和OpenML数据集中因利用上下文信息而显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 未来研究需要更多包含个人信息的真实数据集以进一步提升检测性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM作为评估者（LLM-as-a-Judge）在评分任务中的偏见问题，提出了一个评估框架，并通过实验揭示了评分偏见对稳定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估者在复杂任务中表现优异，但其评分偏见影响了公平性和可靠性，目前研究多集中于比较评估，评分评估中的偏见研究较少。

Method: 定义评分偏见，设计评估框架，通过数据合成构建数据集，设计多维度评估指标。

Result: 实验表明评分偏见会破坏现有评估模型的稳定性，探索性实验为评分提示模板设计和偏见缓解提供了见解。

Conclusion: 评分偏见是LLM-as-a-Judge中的重要问题，需进一步研究以提升评估的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人类语言理解中随机解析策略的局限性，并通过实验验证了复杂输入和意外性对解析策略的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类语言理解并非随机解析，而先前研究表明随机策略也能实现高准确率。本研究旨在验证随机策略在复杂输入和意外性条件下的表现。

Method: 修改实验设置：(I) 使用具有层次结构的复杂输入；(II) 在目标函数中加入意外性相关项。

Result: 评估随机解析策略在修改后的实验条件下是否仍能保持高通信准确率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了随机解析策略在复杂语言环境中的局限性，为理解人类语言解析机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

TL;DR: QuickSilver是一个模块化的推理框架，通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合等机制，显著减少大型语言模型的推理延迟和能耗，无需修改模型权重或结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理是大型语言模型部署中延迟和能耗的主要来源，现有方法需要重新训练或改变架构，QuickSilver旨在解决这一问题。

Method: QuickSilver通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合三种机制，在不改变模型权重或结构的情况下优化推理。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama-2上，QuickSilver实现了高达39.6%的FLOP减少，且困惑度几乎无增加（<=0.2）。

Conclusion: QuickSilver提供了一种高效且兼容的推理优化方法，适用于冻结的密集模型。

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert
fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in

Conclusion: HyperCLOVA X THINK是韩语AI创新的坚实基础，未来将通过剪枝和蒸馏技术进一步优化。

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language
model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion
high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估方法无法反映真实临床诊断的复杂性和迭代性，需要更贴近实际的评估框架。

Method: 将304个NEJM-CPC案例转化为逐步诊断任务，引入MAI-DxO模型，模拟医生团队并提出高效测试策略。

Result: MAI-DxO与OpenAI o3模型结合，诊断准确率达80%，成本降低20%；优化后准确率可达85.5%。

Conclusion: AI系统通过迭代思考和高效行动，可显著提升临床诊断的精确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在细粒度空间推理和多步逻辑对齐方面表现不足。

Method: 使用M3CTS生成多样且逻辑一致的LongCoT推理轨迹，提出fDPO方法优化空间奖励机制。

Result: fDPO在空间质量任务上平均提升4.1%，空间数量任务提升9.0%。SpatialReasoner-R1在SPATIALRGPT-Bench上创下新SoTA。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1通过创新方法显著提升了空间推理能力，同时保持通用视觉语言任务的竞争力。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在全景图像生成中面临几何失真和一致性不足的问题，TanDiT旨在解决这些问题并提升生成质量。

Method: TanDiT使用统一的扩散模型在单次去噪迭代中同时生成切面图像，并提出模型无关的后处理步骤增强全局一致性。

Conclusion: TanDiT通过创新的切面图像生成和后处理步骤，显著提升了全景图像的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉裁剪方法需要任务特定微调、效率低或与高效注意力实现不兼容的问题。

Method: 通过四步实现：识别目标对象、计算对象相关性图、提出并排名相关图像区域、使用排名最高区域执行VQA任务。

Result: 在四个细粒度VQA数据集和两种MLLM上表现优异，优于三种流行视觉裁剪方法，计算量减少3-6.5倍。

Conclusion: FOCUS是一种高效且无需训练的视觉裁剪方法，显著提升细粒度VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CAST的统一模型，通过跨注意力机制融合时空特征，显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有CNN-Transformer模型对时空特征的处理独立且结合方式简单，限制了时空交互的深度。

Method: 提出CAST模型，利用跨注意力机制动态融合时空特征，增强对细微时间演化伪造痕迹的检测能力。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DeepfakeDetection数据集上表现优异，AUC达99.49%，准确率97.57%，跨数据集测试AUC为93.31%。

Conclusion: 跨注意力特征融合显著提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

### [107] [Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation for 3D Self-Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21724)
*Remco F. Leijenaar,Hamidreza Kasaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AsymDSD的自监督学习框架，通过潜在空间预测结合掩码建模和不变性学习，显著提升了3D点云语义表示的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏大规模标注数据集的情况下，如何从无结构的3D点云中学习有意义的语义表示是一个核心挑战。现有的掩码点建模（MPM）方法因其基于重建的目标，可能限制了其捕捉高层次语义的能力。

Method: 提出了AsymDSD框架，采用潜在空间预测而非输入空间预测，结合了掩码建模和不变性学习。关键设计包括非对称设置、屏蔽掩码查询间的注意力以防止形状泄漏、多掩码采样以及点云的多裁剪适应。

Result: 在ScanObjectNN上达到了90.53%的准确率，预训练后进一步提升至93.72%，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: AsymDSD通过创新设计显著提升了3D点云语义表示的性能，为自监督学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k
shapes, surpassing prior methods.

### [108] [Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731)
*Chenqiu Zhao,Anup Basu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个理论框架MESP和LCH，探讨概率生成模型的局限性，即学习全局分布可能导致记忆而非生成行为。MESP源于对VAE的重新思考，提出基于重叠系数的下界，并设计了BL-AE和ARVM模型。LCH假设生成能力源于局部相关性。实验验证了框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究概率生成模型中全局分布学习可能导致记忆而非生成行为的潜在局限性。

Method: 提出MESP框架，基于VAE的重叠问题设计BL-AE和ARVM模型；提出LCH假设，强调局部相关性对生成能力的影响。

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得了竞争性的FID分数，但发现高分反映的是记忆而非生成。LCH假设通过实验验证了局部相关性的重要性。

Conclusion: MESP和LCH框架揭示了概率生成模型的局限性，并提出了改进方向，强调局部相关性对生成能力的关键作用。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is enabling collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This approach is
particularly valuable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access
to trained medical professionals is limited. However, FL adoption in LMICs
faces significant barriers, including limited high-performance computing
resources and unreliable internet connectivity. To address these challenges, we
introduce FedNCA, a novel FL system tailored for medical image segmentation
tasks. FedNCA leverages the lightweight Med-NCA architecture, enabling training
on low-cost edge devices, such as widely available smartphones, while
minimizing communication costs. Additionally, our encryption-ready FedNCA
proves to be suitable for compromised network communication. By overcoming
infrastructural and security challenges, FedNCA paves the way for inclusive,
efficient, lightweight, and encryption-ready medical imaging solutions,
fostering equitable healthcare advancements in resource-constrained regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ImplicitQA基准，测试视频问答模型在隐含推理上的能力，填补现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答基准主要关注显性视觉内容，而忽略了隐含推理（如动机、因果关系等），无法反映人类理解能力。

Method: 构建ImplicitQA基准，包含1K高质量QA对，涵盖多种推理维度（如空间、因果、社交等），并评估现有模型表现。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在隐含推理任务上表现不佳，依赖表面视觉线索。

Conclusion: ImplicitQA填补了隐含推理的空白，为社区提供了研究新方向。

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Conclusion: 该流程为青光眼早期检测提供了可重复且可扩展的方法，具有潜在的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single
datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA,
and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that
minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on
unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical
utility.

Result: GPT-4o表现优于专用模型，但所有模型在自我中心视频中的效果均不如第三人称视频。

Conclusion: 需进一步改进现有方法以应对自我中心视频的独特挑战，提示微调模型展现出潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to
contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively
processing and interpreting egocentric perspectives.

Motivation: 现有数据集仅关注手术分析的孤立方面，缺乏对实体间语义关系的全面表示，因此需要更全面的数据集和方法来捕捉手术流程中的复杂交互。

Method: 论文提出了CAT-SG数据集，包含工具-组织交互、程序变化和时间依赖的结构化标注，并开发了场景图生成模型CatSGG。

Result: CatSGG模型在生成结构化手术表示方面优于现有方法，CAT-SG数据集为手术训练和实时决策支持提供了更全面的视角。

Conclusion: CAT-SG数据集和CatSGG模型为临床实践中的智能、上下文感知系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Result: 在Siegfried数据集上，葡萄园和铁路分割的mIoU分别提升5%和13%；在ICDAR 2021数据集上，建筑块分割的PQ达67.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在极低数据需求下仍保持高性能，显著减少人工标注需求，推动了历史地图自动化处理的发展。

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the

personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.

Result: PrefPaint在医学等领域表现优于现有方法，减少视觉不一致性，生成更真实的息肉图像。

Conclusion: PrefPaint通过人类反馈和交互界面提升了医学图像修复的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

TL;DR: ProSAM提出了一种改进的视觉参考分割方法，通过变分提示编码器生成更稳定的提示，解决了现有SAM方法在边界生成提示的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAM方法在视觉参考分割中因提示编码器不理想，常在物体边界生成提示，导致不稳定性和鲁棒性下降。

Method: ProSAM通过学习变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，避免在边界区域生成提示。

Result: 在Pascal-5i和COCO-20i数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProSAM为视觉参考分割提供了更稳定、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images
that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating.
While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance
reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this
task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning,
layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate
through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and
functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves
output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance
clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅将脑电活动转换为2D图像，忽略了3D空间信息的重建，限制了BCI的实际应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为从EEG数据重建3D视觉刺激提供了新思路，拓展了BCI的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RGB-IR图像对在多模态应用中的普及，数据存储和传输成本成倍增加，因此需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 设计了CCEM模型，包含LCEB和LCFB模块，用于提取和融合跨模态的低频信息，提升熵参数预测的准确性。

Result: 在LLVIP和KAIST数据集上表现优于现有RGB-IR和单模态压缩方法，例如在LLVIP上比特率节省23.1%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过跨模态信息利用显著提升了RGB-IR图像对的压缩效率。

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE是一个整合组织病理学和空间转录组学的基础模型，通过多模态数据融合提升病理任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前病理学领域缺乏对全切片图像（WSI）和空间转录组学（ST）的全面整合，而这对捕捉分子异质性至关重要。

Method: SPADE采用混合数据专家技术和对比学习，整合WSI和ST数据，构建统一的潜在空间。

Result: 在14个下游任务中，SPADE表现出显著的少样本性能优势。

Conclusion: SPADE证明了形态学和分子信息整合的潜力，为病理学任务提供了新方法。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor是一种无需训练的令牌压缩策略，用于视频多模态大语言模型，通过语义连接组件（SCC）实现全面语义覆盖，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力得分的令牌压缩方法无法有效捕捉所有语义区域且导致冗余，需改进。

Method: 提出两步时空令牌压缩策略，利用SCC在空间和时间域分配令牌，确保非重叠语义令牌表示视频。

Result: 在多种视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在低令牌保留率下优于其他方法。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor通过SCC实现了高效令牌压缩，提升了视频多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对遥感（RS）图像理解的新型大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）框架，通过语义增强的多级对齐和语义感知专家建模，解决了通用LVLM在RS领域适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感（RS）领域因视觉外观、对象尺度和语义的显著差异而应用受限。

Method: 提出两个核心组件：语义增强的多级对齐（通过检索式语义增强模块丰富多级视觉特征）和语义感知专家建模（设计不同级别的语义专家）。

Result: 在多个RS任务（如场景分类和视觉问答）中表现优异，实现了跨多语义级别的一致改进。

Conclusion: 该框架有效填补了通用LVLMs与RS特定需求之间的差距，展示了其在RS视觉语言理解中的能力和有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

Result: DPU-Former在多个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DPU-Former通过双视角融合和高效特征处理，显著提升了光学遥感图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GAP的方法，通过调整位置ID来解决多模态大语言模型在视觉定位任务中因token剪枝导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的token剪枝方法虽然降低了计算成本，但显著削弱了模型的视觉定位能力，导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP)，通过简单调整位置ID，无需额外训练或计算开销。

Result: 在RefCOCO验证集上，LLaVA的准确率从剪枝后的15.34%恢复到51.42%，接近原始性能的90%。

Conclusion: GAP方法在各种token剪枝策略中均能有效提升模型性能，适用于多种多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度解释性的框架，用于自动标记训练图像中的问题样本，以提高银屑病严重程度评分的模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银屑病严重程度评分在临床试验中很重要，但存在评估者间变异性和临床评估负担的问题。远程成像虽然提供了可扩展性，但引入了光照、背景和设备质量等挑战，影响模型性能。

Method: 使用基于梯度的解释性方法，追踪误分类验证图像的梯度，检测训练样本中的不一致评分或非临床伪影。应用于基于ConvNeXT的弱监督模型。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了远程评估的自动化评分鲁棒性，减少了手动审核需求，适用于数据收集变异性大的场景。

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据中OOD检测对模型安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有研究较少。3D VLMs在图像领域成功，但在点云中因数据规模小和合成对象多导致域偏移问题。

Method: 提出SODA方法，通过基于邻域的分数传播方案改进OOD检测，无需额外训练，直接应用于推理阶段。

Result: SODA在多个数据集和问题设置中表现优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SODA有效解决了3D VLMs在点云OOD检测中的域偏移问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

TL;DR: ZeroReg3D是一种新型零样本注册方法，用于从连续组织切片构建精确的3D模型，解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D组织学分析方法难以保留3D空间关系，且现有深度学习方法泛化性差或需要大量数据。

Method: 结合零样本深度学习关键点匹配与优化为基础的仿射和非刚性配准技术。

Result: 有效解决了组织变形、切片伪影、染色变异和光照不一致等问题，无需重新训练或微调。

Conclusion: ZeroReg3D为临床和研究应用提供了更准确、通用的3D组织学分析工具。

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on
https://github.com/IntMeGroup/AIGCOIQA to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割面临类别差异、遮挡和物体尺寸变化的挑战，需要提取鲁棒特征和多上下文特征。

Method: 采用两个堆叠的编码器-解码器网络和膨胀残差块（DRB），以捕获长距离语义并保留空间信息。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上的实验表明，SDRNet性能优于当前深度卷积神经网络。

Conclusion: SDRNet通过多上下文特征和全局-局部上下文结合，显著提升了高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割效果。

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Result: 在ScanObjectNN、ModelNet40和ShapeNetPart等数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了点云理解的性能，尤其在语义关系捕捉和下游任务表现上。

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-T分割模型依赖低层视觉特征，缺乏高层文本信息，难以区分视觉相似的类别；SAM在多模态融合中存在计算效率问题。

Method: 使用LoRA微调技术适配视觉基础模型，提出DFFM融合多模态特征，结合CLIP文本嵌入实现语义对齐。

Result: 在多样化数据集上表现优异，参数更少，适用于挑战性场景。

Conclusion: TASeg通过多模态特征融合和文本嵌入，显著提升了RGB-T语义分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖大规模监督训练且缺乏灵活性，而MLLMs在基础任务中表现优异，但直接应用于跟踪任务效果不佳，因此需要改进。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习方法在小规模数据集上微调Qwen2.5-VL，生成R1-Track模型。

Result: R1-Track在GOT-10k基准上表现优异，支持通过边界框或文本描述灵活初始化。

Conclusion: R1-Track展示了MLLMs在视觉跟踪任务中的潜力，并提出了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了长时程视频生成的误差累积问题，显著提升了生成质量和任务执行效果。

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 现代深度神经网络（DNNs）的复杂性和规模快速增长，导致计算成本和内存使用问题，需要更高效的模型压缩技术。现有方法（Torque-inspired regularization）剪枝效果不理想，网络仍密集且准确性下降明显。

Method: 提出ETP方法，采用指数力应用方案进行正则化，有效剪除冗余和远距离模块，保留必要模块。

Result: 在多个领域的实验结果表明，ETP显著提高了压缩率，且准确性下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: ETP是一种简单但高效的剪枝策略，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义保留和伪配对监督，显著提升了面部风格化的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our
dataset and baseline method are publicly available on

Motivation: 零样本语义分割（ZSS）需要在仅使用已见类监督的情况下分割未见类。现有基于蒸馏的方法在视觉语言对齐和特征粒度差异上存在挑战。

Method: 提出Chimera-Seg，结合分割主干和CLIP语义头；设计SGD方法选择性蒸馏全局知识；使用SAM模块进一步对齐视觉和语义特征。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，hIoU分别提升0.9%和1.2%。

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg和SGD有效解决了ZSS中的对齐和粒度问题，实验验证了其性能优势。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

Conclusion: FIAG框架在高效性和通用性上表现优异，为说话头部合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Method: 1. 通过VAE编码图像拼接和自注意力机制注入参考身份；2. 针对LTX时间结构的因果音频编码器和适配器；3. 渐进式训练策略结合面部、半身和手势控制。

Result: 在EMTD Benchmark上，MirrorMe在保真度、唇同步准确性和时间稳定性方面表现最优。

Conclusion: MirrorMe通过创新设计和渐进训练，实现了实时、高保真的音频驱动肖像动画生成。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用单扫描线投影交点估计滚动快门相机相对位姿的新方法，无需显式建模相机运动，适用于单视图或多视图场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决滚动快门相机在结构从运动中位姿估计的挑战，避免复杂的运动建模。

Method: 通过扫描线与线投影的交点估计位姿，支持单视图或多视图场景，并开发了最小求解器处理平行线和已知重力方向的情况。

Result: 在Fastec数据集上验证了方法的可行性，展示了其在滚动快门结构从运动初始化中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为滚动快门结构从运动提供了基础模块，具有进一步发展的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式，通过增加推理时间（计算资源）提升机器在视觉任务中的推理能力，尤其在数据稀缺的情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类推理能力强大，而机器智能仍受限于训练数据，无法在推理时动态优化解决方案。现有研究多集中于语言领域，非语言推理（如视觉、空间推理）仍是挑战。

Method: 受心理学双过程理论启发，结合快速思考的System I模块和慢速思考的System II模块，通过自玩强化学习迭代优化解决方案。

Result: 在视觉任务（包括计算机视觉基准和医学图像癌症定位）中，该方法优于大规模监督学习、基础模型甚至人类专家。

Conclusion: 该范式为非语言机器推理提供了突破性潜力，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现卓越。

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

Result: 在四个rPPG基准数据集上表现优异，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于超短视频，还显著提升了心率测量的准确性。

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高精度物体姿态标注，限制了大规模场景重建。

Method: 使用可学习的Bézier曲线表示动态物体运动轨迹，结合动态物体渲染监督和曲线一致性约束。

Result: 在Waymo和nuPlan数据集上表现优于现有方法，动态和静态场景重建及新视角合成效果更优。

Conclusion: BézierGS通过曲线建模和额外监督，实现了高效准确的场景重建。

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Result: TPM显著提升了分割精度，尤其在多原型和多类分割任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了一种新的原型建模视角，具有更高的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

Conclusion: 自动化管道重建方法支持数字孪生开发，提高建模速度和精度，降低成本。

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

Motivation: 现有张量分解方法（如Tucker和CP）在灵活性和可解释性之间存在权衡，且稀疏解难以获得。CP-INR旨在解决这些问题，同时利用神经网络的非线性能力。

Method: 通过神经网络参数化CP分解，引入Schatten-p拟范数的变分形式实现稀疏性，并提出基于谱范数的平滑正则化。

Result: 在图像修复、去噪和点云上采样等任务中，CP-INR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CP-INR结合了CP分解的天然结构和神经网络的非线性能力，为连续数据表示提供了高效且理论保障的解决方案。

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有视频-LLM采用均匀帧采样，难以有效捕捉视频中的关键时空线索，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出Q-Frame，基于文本-图像匹配网络（如CLIP）进行无训练、即插即用的自适应帧选择，利用Gumbel-Max技巧优化选择。

Result: 在MLVU、LongVideoBench和Video-MME等基准数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Q-Frame能高效处理更多帧，保留关键时空信息，适用于多种视频理解任务。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 通过在视觉输入中添加低层次空间结构（如水平线）并结合文本提示，显著提升了视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉推理中存在绑定问题，难以可靠地将感知特征与正确的视觉对象关联，导致在计数、视觉搜索等任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出一种简单干预：在视觉输入中加入低层次空间结构，并配合鼓励序列化、空间感知解析的文本提示。

Result: 在多个视觉推理任务中取得显著提升，如GPT-4o的视觉搜索准确率提高25.00%，计数准确率提高26.83%。

Conclusion: 低层次视觉结构化是提升视觉语言模型在空间任务中性能的有效且未被充分探索的方向。

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Method: RetFiner采用多任务训练目标，利用文本数据的监督信号优化基础模型的表示能力，无需额外标注即可适应特定人群。

Result: 在七项OCT分类任务中，RetFiner显著提升了RETFound、UrFound和VisionFM模型的线性探测性能，平均分别提高了5.8、3.9和2.1个百分点。

Conclusion: RetFiner通过视觉语言优化，有效提升了基础模型的适应性和下游任务表现，为医学影像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

Motivation: 现有FSOD方法基于Faster R-CNN，将目标性识别和前景分类耦合在共享特征空间中，导致类特定目标性标准和新类别样本不具代表性。

Method: 提出UOFS框架，解耦特征空间为幅度和角度分量；采用HBO策略处理未标记前景实例和背景混淆问题；引入SADA模块解决任务冲突。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基于耦合特征空间的现有方法。

Conclusion: UOFS框架通过解耦特征空间和优化策略，有效提升了FSOD性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉和语义对齐中忽视了细粒度动作模式（如手部动作）的重要性，导致识别效果受限。

Conclusion: FS-VAE通过频率和语义的双重优化，显著提升了零样本骨架动作识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有更高的感知质量和个性化适应性。

Conclusion: ReF-LLE为低光图像增强提供了一种高效且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA通过整合4D信息和优化采样策略，有效解决了预训练中的混乱问题，提升了模型的时空推理能力和适应性。

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

Result: 实验表明，EAMamba在多项任务中FLOPs减少31-89%，性能保持优异。

Conclusion: EAMamba有效解决了Vision Mamba的局限性，为图像恢复任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型是否能够像人类一样利用场景上下文生成物体引用，以及模型在不同场景条件下的适应性。

Method: 引入COOCO数据集，测试模型在不同场景-物体一致性和噪声下的表现，并通过注意力分析模型行为。

Result: 模型会根据场景-物体语义相关性和噪声水平动态调整对上下文的依赖，并在中等噪声下更关注目标物体。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型能够动态平衡局部和上下文信息，尤其在场景-物体高度一致或物体退化时更依赖上下文。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Result: 在多样化基准测试中表现优于现有方法，无需额外训练或复杂修改。

Conclusion: VisionDrop简单有效，提高了推理效率并保持了任务性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

Result: RoomCraft在生成真实、语义连贯且视觉吸引的室内布局方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RoomCraft通过多阶段管道和约束优化框架，有效解决了3D室内场景生成的挑战，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Result: 在广泛认可的基准测试中，OutDreamer在零样本设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OutDreamer通过创新的架构设计和损失函数，显著提升了视频外绘任务的性能。

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了图像匹配和视觉定位的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨检测器特征匹配的挑战，为实际应用提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对特定框架，缺乏通用性且需要训练。WarpRF旨在提供一种无需训练、通用的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 基于光度和几何一致性假设，WarpRF通过反向映射将可靠渲染投影到未知视角，并测量与渲染图像的一致性。

Result: WarpRF在不确定性量化和下游任务（如主动视图选择和主动映射）中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WarpRF是一种简单、低成本且通用的不确定性量化框架，适用于任何辐射场实现。

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method
tailored to specific frameworks.

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

### [1] [Enhancing Dialogue Annotation with Speaker Characteristics Leveraging a Frozen LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04795)
*Thomas Thebaud,Yen-Ju Lu,Matthew Wiesner,Peter Viechnicki,Najim Dehak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在对话转录后处理中添加说话者特征元数据的方法，结合音频基础模型和语言模型，无需微调即可实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在对话转录后处理中补充元数据标签（如年龄、性别、情感）的方法，以丰富转录内容。

Method: 结合冻结的音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）和冻结的LLAMA语言模型，通过轻量级连接器推断说话者属性。

Result: 在说话者分析任务中表现优异，同时保持模块化和速度；LLAMA模型在某些场景下直接比较x-向量，达到8.8%的等错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法为对话转录后处理提供了新的元数据补充方式，展示了冻结模型的潜力。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

### [2] [Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04796)
*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的BPE算法（Parity-aware BPE），旨在解决传统BPE算法在低资源语言中表现不佳的问题，通过优化跨语言压缩均衡性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPE算法依赖频率目标，导致低资源语言的分词效果差，加剧了语言间的计算和金融不平等。

Method: 提出Parity-aware BPE算法，在每一步合并时优先优化当前压缩效果最差的语言，牺牲少量全局压缩率以实现跨语言均衡。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了低资源语言的分词长度均衡性，对全局压缩率和下游任务性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE是一种有效的改进方案，能够在不显著影响性能的前提下提升跨语言分词的公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

### [3] [Pitch Accent Detection improves Pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04814)
*David Sasu,Natalie Schluter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过引入联合ASR和音高重音检测模型，半监督语音表示的性能得到提升，音高重音检测模块显著改进，ASR性能在有限资源下优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过音高重音检测模块提升半监督语音表示的性能，并验证联合训练对ASR和音高重音检测的效果。

Method: 提出联合ASR和音高重音检测模型，利用半监督语音表示进行训练，并在有限资源下微调。

Result: 音高重音检测的F1分数提升41%，ASR的WER在LibriSpeech上降低28.3%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，扩展预训练语音模型以保留或重新学习音高重音等韵律线索具有重要意义。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

### [4] [Persistent Instability in LLM's Personality Measurements: Effects of Scale, Reasoning, and Conversation History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04826)
*Tommaso Tosato,Saskia Helbling,Yorguin-Jose Mantilla-Ramos,Mahmood Hegazy,Alberto Tosato,David John Lemay,Irina Rish,Guillaume Dumas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了PERSIST框架，评估25+开源大语言模型在50万+回答中的性格稳定性，发现即使400B+模型也存在显著行为不一致性，提示当前LLM缺乏行为一致性基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型的行为一致性对安全部署至关重要，但其性格特质尚未被充分理解。

Method: 使用传统和LLM适配的性格测量工具，系统测试模型在不同提示条件下的行为变化。

Result: 发现模型行为存在显著不稳定性，干预措施可能增加变异性，LLM适配工具与传统工具表现相似。

Conclusion: 当前LLM缺乏行为一致性基础，性格对齐策略可能不足以满足安全关键应用需求。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

### [5] [RCR-Router: Efficient Role-Aware Context Routing for Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Structured Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04903)
*Jun Liu,Zhenglun Kong,Changdi Yang,Fan Yang,Tianqi Li,Peiyan Dong,Joannah Nanjekye,Hao Tang,Geng Yuan,Wei Niu,Wenbin Zhang,Pu Zhao,Xue Lin,Dong Huang,Yanzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCR-Router是一种模块化、角色感知的上下文路由框架，旨在提高多代理LLM系统的协作效率，减少令牌消耗并提升适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协调方案依赖静态或全上下文路由策略，导致令牌消耗过多、内存冗余且适应性差。

Method: RCR-Router动态选择语义相关的内存子集，基于角色和任务阶段，并采用轻量级评分策略指导内存选择。

Result: 在三个多跳QA基准测试中，RCR-Router减少令牌使用（高达30%），同时保持或提升答案质量。

Conclusion: 结构化内存路由和输出感知评估对推进可扩展多代理LLM系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

### [6] [I Think, Therefore I Am Under-Qualified? A Benchmark for Evaluating Linguistic Shibboleth Detection in LLM Hiring Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04939)
*Julia Kharchenko,Tanya Roosta,Aman Chadha,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLMs）对语言特征的响应的基准，揭示了模型如何无意中暴露人口统计偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是检测和量化LLMs在处理语言特征时可能产生的偏见，特别是在自动评估系统中对不同人口统计群体的不公平对待。

Method: 通过100个经过验证的问题-回答对构建的访谈模拟，生成控制语言变体以隔离特定现象，同时保持语义等价。

Result: 研究发现，带有犹豫语言特征的回应平均评分低25.6%，验证了基准在识别模型特定偏见方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文建立了一个基础框架，用于检测和测量AI系统中的语言歧视，对自动决策中的公平性具有广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

### [7] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言聚类的框架，用于解决动作识别评估中的语义模糊问题，比传统方法更符合人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于单一答案的评估方法无法捕捉动作描述的语义模糊性，导致模型性能评估不完整。

Method: 提出视觉语言聚类框架，构建动词意义簇，对图像动作进行多视角评估。

Result: 在imSitu数据集中，每张图像平均映射到2.8个意义簇，聚类评估与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 聚类评估方法能更全面地反映模型性能，优于传统评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

### [8] [A Multi-Stage Large Language Model Framework for Extracting Suicide-Related Social Determinants of Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05003)
*Song Wang,Yishu Wei,Haotian Ma,Max Lovitt,Kelly Deng,Yuan Meng,Zihan Xu,Jingze Zhang,Yunyu Xiao,Ying Ding,Xuhai Xu,Joydeep Ghosh,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多阶段大语言模型框架，用于从非结构化文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDoH），以解决自杀事件中的早期干预问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对自杀事件的影响至关重要，但现有数据驱动方法面临长尾分布、关键压力源分析和模型可解释性不足等挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段大语言模型框架，并与BioBERT、GPT-3.5-turbo和DeepSeek-R1等先进模型对比，同时评估模型解释对标注效率的提升。

Result: 框架在SDoH提取和相关上下文检索任务中表现更优，且通过微调小模型实现了性能相当但成本更低的效果。多阶段设计提升了模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了从非结构化文本中提取自杀相关SDoH的准确性和透明度，有助于早期风险识别和预防策略制定。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

### [9] [Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction via Structural Entropy Minimization Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05023)
*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构熵最小化的方法，将对话分割为语义独立的子对话，以减少噪声并提高情感四元组提取的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设情感元素均匀分布，但实际对话中语义独立的子对话可能引入噪声。

Method: 使用结构熵最小化算法分割对话，并采用两步框架（先提取情感元素，后匹配四元组）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DiaASQ任务中达到最优性能且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 通过子对话分割和两步提取框架，有效提升了情感四元组提取的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

### [10] [Evaluation of LLMs in AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05028)
*Shu Han Ho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了四种解码器架构的LLM在AMR解析中的表现，发现简单微调即可达到与复杂SOTA解析器相当的性能，其中LLaMA 3.2表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索解码器架构的LLM在AMR解析中的潜力，验证简单微调是否能媲美复杂SOTA方法。

Method: 微调四种LLM架构（Phi 3.5、Gemma 2、LLaMA 3.2、DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled），使用LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0测试集进行评估。

Result: LLaMA 3.2在语义性能上领先，Phi 3.5在结构有效性上表现最佳，SMATCH F1达0.804，接近SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 简单微调解码器LLM可实现与复杂SOTA解析器相当的性能，为AMR解析提供了新方向。

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

### [11] [Align, Don't Divide: Revisiting the LoRA Architecture in Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05078)
*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Align-LoRA，挑战了多任务学习中多适配器或多头的复杂结构，证明简化结构和共享表示更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中，现有方法倾向于使用复杂的多适配器或多头结构，但作者发现这些方法可能并非最优。

Method: 提出Align-LoRA，通过增加单适配器的秩并引入对齐损失来优化共享表示。

Result: Align-LoRA显著优于基线方法，验证了共享表示的重要性。

Conclusion: 简化结构和学习共享表示是多任务学习中更有效的范式。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/jinda-liu/Align-LoRA.

*Aditya Kishore,Gaurav Kumar,Jasabanta Patro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MultiCheck的多模态事实核查框架，结合文本和图像信号进行细粒度验证，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态错误信息的增长对依赖文本的事实核查系统提出了挑战，需要一种能够同时处理文本和图像的方法。

Method: MultiCheck框架结合专用文本和图像编码器，通过融合模块捕获跨模态关系，并使用对比学习目标优化语义对齐。

Result: 在Factify 2数据集上，加权F1得分为0.84，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了显式多模态推理的有效性，具有在复杂现实场景中实现可扩展和可解释事实核查的潜力。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

### [13] [BEE-RAG: Balanced Entropy Engineering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05100)
*Yuhao Wang,Ruiyang Ren,Yucheng Wang,Jing Liu,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BEE-RAG的框架，通过熵不变性原理改进检索增强生成（RAG）系统对不同上下文长度的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG因长上下文导致的熵增长和注意力稀释问题。

Method: 利用平衡上下文熵重新制定注意力动态，引入零样本推理策略和参数高效自适应微调机制。

Result: 在多个RAG任务中验证了BEE-RAG的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG通过熵工程显著提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

### [14] [Attention Basin: Why Contextual Position Matters in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05128)
*Zihao Yi,Delong Zeng,Zhenqing Ling,Haohao Luo,Zhe Xu,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Wanxia Cao,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AttnRank的注意力驱动重排序方法，通过调整输入序列中关键信息的位置以优化大型语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）对输入信息位置敏感性的机制，发现模型倾向于关注序列开头和结尾的信息（注意力盆地现象）。

Method: 提出AttnRank框架，通过校准集估计模型的注意力偏好，并重排输入序列以对齐高注意力位置。

Result: 实验表明，AttnRank在多种任务和模型上显著提升了性能，无需修改模型参数或训练过程。

Conclusion: AttnRank是一种高效、通用的方法，能够显著提升LLMs的性能，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

*Chang Hong,Minghao Wu,Qingying Xiao,Yuchi Wang,Xiang Wan,Guangjun Yu,Benyou Wang,Yan Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrinciplismQA是一个包含3648个问题的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在医疗伦理方面的表现，发现模型在伦理知识与应用间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试常忽视大语言模型在医疗伦理推理方面的评估，因此需要系统性工具填补这一空白。

Method: 基于Principlism理论，构建高质量数据集，包括选择题和开放式问题，经医学专家验证。

Result: 实验显示模型在动态应用伦理原则时表现不佳，尤其是关于Beneficence的困境。封闭模型领先，医学领域微调可提升伦理能力。

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA为诊断伦理弱点提供了可扩展框架，推动更平衡、负责任的医疗AI发展。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Task 3, focusing on detecting hallucinated text spans in question answering
systems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Natural
Language Generation (NLG) but remain susceptible to hallucinations, generating
incorrect or misleading content. To address this, we explored methods both with
and without external context, utilizing few-shot prompting with a LLM,
token-level classification or LLM fine-tuned on synthetic data. Notably, our
approaches achieved top rankings in Spanish and competitive placements in
English and German. This work highlights the importance of integrating relevant
context to mitigate hallucinations and demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned
models and prompt engineering.

Method: 采用“教师-助理-学生”蒸馏范式，先利用高性能MLLM生成初始推理数据集，训练中等规模的助理模型，再联合训练轻量级学生模型进行推理和分类。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，仅3B参数的MulCoT-RD在JMSRC任务中表现优异，具有强泛化能力和解释性。

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD为资源受限环境下的多模态情感分析提供了高效、轻量且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖人工标注的指令进行强化学习，但高质量指令收集成本高且难以扩展，而代码片段资源丰富，这种不平衡成为瓶颈。

Method: CodeBoost包含最大团选择、双向预测、错误感知预测、异构增强和异构奖励五个关键组件。

Result: 实验表明，CodeBoost在多模型和基准测试中持续提升性能。

Conclusion: CodeBoost是一种可扩展且高效的后训练框架。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Motivation: 研究CoT推理链中错误的实际影响，挑战‘级联失败’假设，揭示晚期错误的更大危害性。

Method: 提出ASCoT方法，包含自适应验证管理器（AVM）和多视角自校正引擎（MSCE），通过位置影响评分和双路径校正解决晚期脆弱性。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH基准测试中，ASCoT表现优异，超越标准CoT等基线方法。

Conclusion: 强调诊断LLM推理中特定失败模式的重要性，提倡转向自适应、针对脆弱性的校正机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

Result: 实验表明，合成数据质量更高，定制代理优于通用代理，实际应用中能有效提升元评审效率。

Conclusion: 对话代理在元评审中具有潜力，合成数据训练方法为相关任务提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Result: 在不同规模的模型（39M至1.3B参数）中，SONAR-LLM表现出竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM在保留LCM优点的同时改进了训练方法，并公开了代码和预训练模型以促进研究。

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LRLMs因过度反思导致的token浪费和推理成本增加问题。

Method: 动态抑制模型在自信时的反思触发词生成，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，token使用减少18.5%至41.9%，准确性不变。

Conclusion: CGRS在效率和性能间取得平衡，适用于不同规模和架构的模型。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 探索可调整手语虚拟形象对用户体验和理解性的影响，以改进手语技术。

Method: 通过专家德国手语（DGS）用户与可调整和不可调整虚拟形象的交互分析，评估关键因素。

Result: 用户偏好可调整设置，但理解性和用户体验未显著提升；系统在情感上更受欢迎，但功能实用性不足。

Conclusion: 个性化不足，需默认提高虚拟形象的理解性；建议改进口型和面部动画、交互界面，并采用参与式设计。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM自我纠正提供了见解，并为未来比较LLM生成反馈与人类专家输入的效果奠定了基础。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Motivation: 解决LLMs因训练数据偏向高资源语言（如英语和中文）导致的文化偏见问题，特别是在低资源语言环境中。

Method: 设计MyCulture基准，涵盖马来西亚文化的六个方面，采用开放式多选题格式，分析结构和语言偏见。

Result: 评估显示LLMs在文化理解上存在显著差异，突显需要文化和语言包容的基准。

Conclusion: MyCulture为LLMs的文化评估提供了更公平和全面的方法，强调文化和语言包容的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human

### [31] [LAG: Logic-Augmented Generation from a Cartesian Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05509)
*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Su Dong,Shengyuan Chen,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG)方法，通过逻辑分解和依赖感知推理增强大语言模型在知识密集型任务中的表现，减少幻觉并提升推理鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中表现不佳，常产生幻觉，而现有的检索增强生成方法在复杂推理场景中效果有限。

Method: LAG将复杂问题分解为原子子问题，按逻辑依赖顺序解决，并通过逻辑终止机制防止错误传播。

Result: 实验表明，LAG显著提升了推理鲁棒性，减少了幻觉，并与人类认知更一致。

Conclusion: LAG为现有检索增强生成系统提供了一种基于逻辑的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

*Harsh Nishant Lalai,Raj Sanjay Shah,Jiaxin Pei,Sashank Varma,Yi-Chia Wang,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过20 Questions游戏评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在地理实体推理中的表现，发现模型对全球北方和西方的实体推理能力显著优于全球南方和东方。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs已通过调优减少显性偏见，但其预训练数据中的隐性偏见仍然存在。传统方法通过人工提问可能触发模型的防护机制，因此作者提出让模型主动提问以研究其行为。

Method: 使用Geo20Q+数据集，在七种语言中测试LLMs在两种游戏配置（标准20问题和无限回合）下的表现，分析地理和文化差异。

Result: LLMs对全球北方和西方的实体推理能力更强，且语言对性能差距影响较小。维基百科页面浏览量和预训练语料频率与性能相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 研究表明自由形式的评估框架能揭示LLMs的隐性偏见，并发现其推理过程中存在地理和文化差异。数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoLex是一种解码策略，通过动态结合模型生成的词汇分布和从上下文中复制的分布，提高法律文本生成的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律领域有潜力，但因其生成不可靠或虚构内容的问题而受限。检索增强生成虽能提供外部知识，但无法保证上下文有效整合。

Method: 提出CoCoLex，一种基于置信度的复制解码策略，动态结合模型生成和上下文复制，确保更高忠实度。

Result: 在五个法律基准测试中，CoCoLex优于现有上下文感知解码方法，尤其在长文本生成任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoCoLex通过增强上下文的忠实整合，显著提升了法律文本生成的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

*Guang Yang,Xinyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频率的不确定性量化方法，用于提升大型语言模型在多选题问答中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多选题问答中存在不可靠性（如幻觉和过度自信），限制了其在高风险领域的应用。

Method: 采用频率不确定性量化方法，利用共形预测确保覆盖保证，通过多次独立采样计算预测熵。

Result: 在六个大型语言模型和四个数据集上的实验表明，频率预测熵优于基于logit的方法，并能有效控制误覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法为多选题问答提供了一个分布无关、模型无关的可靠不确定性量化框架，增强了实际应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

### [35] [Do Political Opinions Transfer Between Western Languages? An Analysis of Unaligned and Aligned Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05553)
*Franziska Weeber,Tanise Ceron,Sebastian Padó*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，多语言大语言模型（MLLMs）在未对齐时表现出极少的跨语言政治观点差异，而政治对齐后观点在五种西方语言中几乎一致变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨跨文化政治观点差异是否在多语言大语言模型中体现为跨语言差异。

Method: 通过提示MLLMs对政治声明表达（不）同意，评估其观点；使用直接偏好优化和英语对齐数据对模型进行政治对齐前后的对比分析。

Result: 未对齐模型的政治观点跨语言差异极少；政治对齐后观点在五种语言中几乎一致变化。

Conclusion: 在西方语言背景下，政治观点在语言间传递，突显了实现MLLMs的社会语言、文化和政治对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

TL;DR: MathSmith是一个新框架，通过从PlanetMath随机采样概念-解释对生成高难度数学问题，增强LLM推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成方法依赖人工模板，缺乏多样性和扩展性，限制了LLM在数学推理上的进步。

Method: MathSmith从零构建问题，采用九种预定义策略增加难度，并通过强化学习优化结构有效性、推理复杂性和答案一致性。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，MathSmith在短链和长链推理设置下均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MathSmith展示了高难度合成数据在提升LLM推理能力方面的潜力，具有强扩展性和泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出Cooper框架，通过联合优化策略模型和奖励模型，结合规则奖励的高精度和动态样本选择，提升强化学习的鲁棒性并减少奖励破解风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型（规则奖励和模型奖励）存在局限性：规则奖励缺乏鲁棒性，模型奖励易受奖励破解影响。

Method: 提出Cooper框架，动态构建正负样本对优化奖励模型，并引入混合标注策略和基于参考的奖励建模范式。

Result: 实验显示Cooper缓解了奖励破解问题，并在Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct上实现了0.54%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型是解决奖励破解的有效方法，为奖励模型与强化学习的更好结合提供了参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在具身任务中的推理能力，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过文本环境表示，模拟1500个场景，评估模型在工具使用和多智能体协调中的表现。

Result: 模型在明确指令下表现良好（85-96%），但在动态工具推理（56-85%）和隐式协作（63-85%）中表现下降，多任务失败率超50%。

Conclusion: 具身推理对现有模型构成根本性挑战，OmniEAR为评估和推进具身AI提供了严格基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Motivation: 推理大语言模型（R-LLMs）在长事实性任务中容易产生幻觉，且现有在线强化学习方法因缺乏可靠验证机制而难以直接应用。

Method: 提出一种综合考虑事实精确性、详细程度和相关性的奖励函数，并应用于在线强化学习。

Result: 在六个长事实性基准测试中，模型平均减少23.1%的幻觉率，回答详细程度提升23%，且整体回答有用性未下降。

Conclusion: 新奖励函数有效提升了R-LLMs在长事实性任务中的表现，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用线性探针（linear probes）研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮对话中的说服动态，发现其在分析说服成功、被说服者个性和说服策略方面表现优异，甚至优于基于提示的方法。

Motivation: 理解LLMs如何说服人类，以及如何高效分析这种动态。

Method: 应用线性探针分析多轮对话中的说服动态，结合认知科学训练探针。

Result: 探针能有效捕捉说服动态的多个方面，如说服成功点和策略，且在某些情况下优于提示方法。

Conclusion: 线性探针是研究复杂行为（如欺骗和操纵）的高效工具，尤其适用于多轮对话和大规模数据分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Motivation: 解决字节级语言模型在形态丰富语言中因单词占用多字节而面临的计算挑战。

Method: 提出H-NET++模型，包括轻量级Transformer上下文混合器、两级潜在超先验、专门处理拼写伪影（如波斯ZWNJ）以及基于课程的分阶段序列长度训练。

Result: 在1.4B标记的波斯语语料库上，H-NET++实现了最佳结果：比基于BPE的GPT-2-fa压缩率提高12%，ParsGLUE提升5.4pp，ZWNJ损坏鲁棒性提高53%，形态边界F1达到73.8%。

Conclusion: H-NET++证明了分层动态分块是一种无需显式监督的有效无分词器解决方案，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如下采样或频域转换）在UHD图像恢复中存在信息丢失或局部退化失效的问题，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: RetinexDual结合了Scale-Attentive maMBA（SAMBA）和Frequency Illumination Adaptor（FIA）两个子网络，分别处理反射和光照问题。

Result: 在去雨、去模糊、去雾和低光增强等任务中，RetinexDual在质量和定量指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual通过双分支设计和各组件的高效协作，为UHD图像恢复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共基准在ENT内窥镜分析中缺乏对分类和病例检索的支持，且设备、操作者差异及细微病变增加了分析难度。

Method: 提出ENTRep数据集，包含专家标注的图像（解剖区域和异常状态）及双语描述，定义三个基准任务并标准化提交协议。

Conclusion: ENTRep为ENT内窥镜分析提供了全面的基准，支持分类和检索任务，填补了现有空白。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

TL;DR: CoMAD是一个轻量级、无参数的框架，通过整合多个自监督ViT模型的优势，将知识蒸馏到一个紧凑的学生网络中，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法通常独立预训练，忽略了互补性，导致模型庞大且不适用于资源受限的场景。

Method: CoMAD通过非对称掩码和联合共识门控，从多个预训练ViT教师模型中蒸馏知识，学生网络仅看到部分图像块，需在丰富上下文中插补缺失特征。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，ViT-Tiny达到75.4% Top-1准确率；在ADE20K和MS-COCO上，密集预测任务表现优异。

Conclusion: CoMAD在紧凑自监督蒸馏领域确立了新的SOTA，展示了多教师知识整合的有效性。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了一种高效的眼球追踪算法，未来将通过LRP进一步提升模型性能。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测精度和计算效率之间难以平衡，LuKAN旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，计算效率高。

Conclusion: LuKAN在精度和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个新框架，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在识别细粒度视觉线索和结合世界知识进行复杂推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估MLLMs的视觉能力时存在不足，无法充分测试模型对细微视觉线索的解析和复杂推理能力。

Method: VER-Bench包含374个精心设计的问题，涵盖多种推理类型，每个问题附带结构化证据（视觉线索和相关推理）。

Result: VER-Bench揭示了当前模型在提取细微视觉证据和构建基于证据的论证方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要增强模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

Conclusion: 多模态查询适应和双流注意力机制显著提升了目标检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态仇恨视频的时间动态，强调需要时间感知的模型和基准以提高鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光检测方法因固定模型无法适应不同测试视频的独特特性，导致性能下降。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证，Highlight-TTA显著提升了现有模型的性能。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA通过动态适应测试视频特性，有效提高了高光检测的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，将基于透视图像训练的单目深度估计器（FMDEs）扩展到鱼眼图像，通过校准令牌调整潜在嵌入分布，无需重新训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs在鱼眼图像上因相机校准参数变化导致深度估计错误，需解决分布偏移问题。

Method: 引入校准令牌作为轻量级适配机制，调整潜在嵌入分布，利用自监督学习从透视图像生成鱼眼图像并强制估计一致性。

Result: 在室内外场景中，方法优于现有技术，仅需一组令牌即可适配多种FMDEs。

Conclusion: 通过校准令牌调整潜在嵌入分布，有效解决了FMDEs在鱼眼图像上的分布偏移问题，无需额外训练数据。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

Result: 实验表明ProMIM在零样本和少样本分类任务中显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: ProMIM为视觉语言应用提供了一种轻量且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

Conclusion: TRKT通过关系感知和动态增强的知识转移，显著提升了弱监督动态场景图生成的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Motivation: 自监督学习在无标注数据中表现优异，但其对领域偏移的鲁棒性不明确，尤其在生物医学图像中，批次效应可能掩盖真实信号。

Conclusion: AdvDINO不仅适用于生物医学图像，还可推广到其他领域，解决领域偏移和标注数据不足的问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: HOW-Seg通过人类反馈动态优化预测，显著提升基类和新型类的分割质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

Conclusion: 自适应权重和不确定性学习显著提升3DGS在稀疏视角场景中的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散图像压缩方法存在解码延迟高和保真度差的问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用预训练的VAE模型生成信息丰富的潜在表示，用单步解码替代多步去噪过程，并引入保真度引导模块和速率退火训练策略。

Result: SODEC在速率-失真-感知性能上显著优于现有方法，解码速度提升超过20倍。

Conclusion: SODEC通过单步解码和保真度优化，有效解决了扩散图像压缩的瓶颈问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用深度基础模型增强深度补全鲁棒性的新框架，无需大规模训练，在OOD场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的深度补全模型在OOD场景中性能显著下降，而基础模型在单目深度估计中表现出色，因此探索如何利用基础模型提升深度补全的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用深度基础模型从RGB图像中提取环境线索（结构和语义上下文），设计无参数的双空间传播方法（3D和2D），并引入可学习的校正模块逐步调整深度预测。

Result: 在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上训练，并在16个其他数据集上评估，OOD场景中表现优异，超越现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了深度补全的鲁棒性，为OOD场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练视觉语言模型在无监督域适应中存在模态间隙问题，导致仅传递模态不变知识，性能不佳。

Method: 设计模态分离框架，分离模态组件并分别处理；提出模态差异度量分类样本；结合提示调优技术。

Result: 在多种实验设置下，性能提升高达9%，计算效率提高9倍。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

Motivation: 探索快速学习如何通过快速权重（如LoRA）在深度神经网络中实现全局上下文敏感性，模拟大脑的快速学习机制。

Method: 使用ViT自编码器和LoRA技术，分析自注意力机制和快速权重对全局上下文学习的影响。

Result: ViT自编码器模拟了神经回路的流形变换，早期层与顶层表征对齐，LoRA显著增强了全局敏感性。

Conclusion: 快速权重架构为研究大脑快速全局学习提供了计算模型，早期层通过训练获得全局敏感性。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

TL;DR: AG-ReID提出了一种基于预训练模型的属性引导框架，通过两阶段处理提升遮挡场景下的行人重识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在遮挡场景中因忽略细粒度属性信息而表现不佳，需改进以处理部分遮挡和细微外观差异。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先生成属性伪标签捕捉细粒度特征，再通过双引导机制结合整体和细粒度信息优化特征提取。

Result: AG-ReID在多个Re-ID数据集上达到最优性能，显著提升遮挡和细微差异的处理能力。

Conclusion: AG-ReID通过属性引导机制有效解决了遮挡场景中的行人重识别问题，同时保持标准场景的竞争力。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

*Shivani Mall,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRAM的视频持续学习方法，通过压缩视频数据并动态刷新存储的嵌入来减少内存占用，同时解决灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频持续学习因高内存需求和灾难性遗忘而具有挑战性，传统方法难以应对长视频和连续流数据。

Method: 使用压缩视觉技术存储视频嵌入而非原始数据，并通过动态刷新嵌入来缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700等大规模数据集上，CRAM方法显著减少了内存占用并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CRAM方法为视频持续学习提供了一种高效且内存友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像数据的高变异性与复杂性导致现有视觉语言模型在医学领域的泛化能力不足。

Method: MCDRL分两步：利用CLIP识别病灶区域并构建混淆字典，再训练因果干预网络消除领域特异性影响。

Result: 实验表明MCDRL在分割准确性和泛化性上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MCDRL有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域泛化问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Result: 分析了现有方法在评估AI-UGC感知质量方面的表现。

Conclusion: AU-IQA为AI-UGC质量评估提供了重要基准，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，早期诊断和准确治疗对提高患者生存率至关重要。手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且导致医生疲劳，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记，减少对大规模标注数据的需求。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入了MedConceptEval和CCS两个新指标评估临床相关性。

Conclusion: skin-SOAP框架能有效减轻医生负担，提升临床文档的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型的快速发展需要超越人类感知的图像质量评估方法，尤其是确保场景构图结构的完整性。

Method: 提出SCSSIM，一种基于统计分析和立方体层次分区的训练免费度量方法，用于评估SCS的保持情况。

Result: SCSSIM对非构图失真具有高不变性，对构图失真表现出单调递减，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SCSSIM是一种高效的结构评估工具，适用于生成模型的开发和评估，确保场景构图的完整性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Result: 在MEVID等基准测试中，HAMoBE显著提升了性能（如Rank-1准确率提升13.0%）。

Conclusion: HAMoBE通过模仿人类感知机制和自适应特征整合，为视频行人重识别提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Conclusion: Spot-IT有效提升了MLLMs在细粒度文档理解任务中的表现，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both

with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有持续语义分割方法中因类别标签与分割掩码紧密耦合导致的旧新类别学习干扰问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用预训练文本和图像编码器生成类别特定信息和位置感知提示；第二阶段利用Segment Anything Model（SAM）生成精确分割掩码。

Result: DecoupleCSS在多种挑战性任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS通过解耦设计有效平衡了持续学习中的保留与适应性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN和扩散模型方法依赖额外控制模块或损失函数，可能引入误差，导致迁移效果不佳。

Method: 基于FLUX-Kontext框架，利用源图像作为条件输入，并引入轻量级RefLoRAInjector提取化妆特征。设计了高效数据生成流程。

Result: FLUX-Makeup在实验中表现最优，具有强鲁棒性，生成的数据集质量显著优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup无需辅助模块即可实现高质量化妆迁移，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: AdaFusion是一个动态整合多个病理基础模型（PFMs）知识的提示引导推理框架，通过轻量级注意力机制自适应融合特征，提升下游任务的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs在自监督预训练中表现出强大的表征能力，但其预训练背景的多样性和不透明性引入了潜在偏差，限制了其在下游应用中的通用性和透明度。

Method: 提出AdaFusion框架，通过压缩和对齐来自不同模型的瓦片级特征，并利用轻量级注意力机制根据组织表型上下文自适应融合这些特征。

Result: 在三个真实世界基准测试中，AdaFusion在分类和回归任务中均优于单个PFM，同时提供了对模型生物语义专业化的可解释性洞察。

Conclusion: AdaFusion能够桥接异构PFMs，既提升了性能，又增强了模型特定归纳偏差的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

TL;DR: PoseGen是一种新框架，通过单张参考图像和驱动姿势序列生成任意长度的视频，解决了扩散模型在身份漂移和视频长度限制上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成长视频时存在身份漂移和视频长度限制的问题，PoseGen旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 采用in-context LoRA微调策略，在token级别注入主题外观以保持身份，同时在通道级别条件化姿势信息以控制运动。通过分段生成和共享KV缓存机制实现无缝拼接。

Result: 在33小时的小规模视频数据集上训练，PoseGen在身份保真度、姿势准确性和生成无限长度视频方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseGen通过创新的微调和分段生成方法，成功解决了长视频生成中的身份漂移和长度限制问题。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

TL;DR: SMP（Sculpting Margin Penalty）是一种新型的FSCIL方法，通过在不同阶段策略性地整合边际惩罚，解决了基类和新类之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据隐私和获取成本限制了训练数据的充足性，导致增量学习性能下降，现有方法难以平衡基类区分性和新类泛化性。

Method: 提出SMP方法，包括MIAM机制（基任务学习）和MPCC策略（增量任务），通过边际惩罚优化分类器。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200上的实验表明，SMP在FSCIL中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SMP通过边际惩罚策略有效平衡了基类和新类的性能，提升了FSCIL的效果。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多实例学习在病理图像分类中因处理大量补丁导致的高推理成本问题。

Method: 提出AHDMIL框架，包含DMIN和DB-LIPN网络，通过自蒸馏和不对称蒸馏两阶段训练，结合CKA分类器优化性能。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上表现优于现有方法，分类性能和推理速度均有提升，如Camelyon16数据集上准确率提高5.3%，推理速度加快1.2倍。

Conclusion: AHDMIL通过高效补丁筛选和CKA分类器，显著提升了病理图像分类的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言增强方法主要局限于文本模态或机器翻译，忽视了多模态信息和文化基础的重要性，导致低资源语言环境下MLLM效果不佳。

Method: 提出双源数据策略，分别从本地网络获取文化相关数据（如alt-text）和MLLM生成的语言相关数据，构建MELLA数据集，并通过微调提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，在MELLA上微调后，八种语言的MLLM性能普遍提升，模型生成更丰富的描述，验证了文化和语言能力的双重增强。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化和语言能力对低资源语言MLLM的重要性，MELLA数据集为未来研究提供了实用资源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉定位任务（如RIS和REC）通常依赖单一文本输入，无法充分利用丰富的视觉信息，容易导致误识别。

Method: 引入主题分配器和视觉概念注入器模块，将共享主题和独特属性概念嵌入潜在表示，并提出正边距对比学习策略以对齐潜在表达与原始文本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有RIS和REC方法，并在GRES基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过多潜在表达和互补视觉细节的结合，显著提升了视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的链式思维方法在视觉语言推理任务中表现不佳，主要因为视觉状态转换建模能力有限或架构碎片化导致的视觉轨迹不连贯。

Method: Uni-CoT采用双层推理范式：宏观层用于任务规划，微观层用于子任务执行，并结合图像-文本监督和多任务目标进行训练。

Result: 在WISE、RISE和KRIS基准测试中，Uni-CoT表现出SOTA性能和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT为多模态推理提供了一种高效且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Method: 提出FedGIN框架，集成GIN模块进行局部训练时的模态强度分布协调，评估了在有限数据和完整数据场景下的性能。

Result: 在有限数据场景下，FedGIN比无GIN的FL性能提升12-18%；在完整数据场景下，接近集中式性能，跨模态泛化能力显著。

Conclusion: FedGIN在隐私保护下实现了多模态医学图像分割的高效泛化，为临床工作流提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Result: GUI-RC在ScreenSpot基准上提升2-3%准确率；GUI-RCPO进一步优化至85.14%。

Conclusion: 测试时缩放和强化学习为GUI定位提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related

Conclusion: 提出的旋转等变ASISR方法有效解决了几何模式失真问题，为图像超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR

Result: 在UniMo4D数据集上，X-MoGen在已知和未知物种上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: X-MoGen首次实现了跨物种文本驱动运动生成的统一框架，解决了形态差异问题，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

TL;DR: PhysPatch是一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）自动驾驶系统的物理可实现对抗性补丁框架，优化补丁位置、形状和内容以提高攻击效果和实际适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁攻击方法主要针对目标检测模型，在MLLM系统中表现不佳，因此需要一种专门针对MLLM的物理可实现攻击方法。

Method: PhysPatch通过联合优化补丁位置、形状和内容，引入语义掩码初始化策略、SVD局部对齐损失和势场掩码细化方法。

Result: PhysPatch在开源、商业和推理能力强的MLLM中显著优于现有方法，能有效引导AD系统产生目标对齐的感知和规划输出。

Conclusion: PhysPatch在物理可行区域放置对抗性补丁，确保实际适用性和部署性，为MLLM系统的安全性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Result: 在通用多目标跟踪基准测试中，MTT表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: MTT框架通过轨迹片段增强和多线索关联，有效提升了未见类别目标的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: SPA++ 通过谱对齐和一致性正则化，显著提升了域适应的性能，适用于多种复杂场景。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: SPEX是首个专注于光谱遥感图像地物提取的多模态视觉语言模型，具有高精度和可解释性。

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

TL;DR: EndoMatcher通过大规模多域数据预训练和双分支Vision Transformer，解决了内窥镜图像匹配中的视觉条件和数据稀缺问题，显著提升了匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像匹配在机器人辅助任务中至关重要，但由于视觉条件复杂（如弱纹理、大视角变化）和标注数据稀缺，现有方法难以泛化。

Method: 提出EndoMatcher，采用双分支Vision Transformer提取多尺度特征，并通过双交互块增强对应学习；构建多域数据集Endo-Mix6，采用渐进多目标训练策略。

Result: 在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上，匹配内点数量分别提升140.69%和201.43%，在Gastro-Matching数据集上MDPA提升9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher在零样本设置下实现了跨器官和成像条件的泛化，为内窥镜图像匹配提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型（LMMs）中视觉令牌冗余导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出重要性映射和渐进式剪枝模块，结合视觉信息流优化剪枝策略。

Result: 剪枝90%视觉令牌，性能接近原始模型，减少89% KV-Cache内存，推理速度提升3.8倍。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt有效平衡了计算效率和模型性能，适用于多种LMMs。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Motivation: 解决跨域少样本分割中因域差异导致的性能下降问题，同时满足数据隐私和减少数据传输的需求。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在跨域少样本分割任务中表现出色，且无需源域数据，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack框架显著提升了视觉语言跟踪性能，并通过新数据集TNLLT为任务提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够准确分割高度非凸、不规则的气泡结构。

Conclusion: 通过现代视觉基础模型的迁移学习，可以有效解决多相流中复杂气泡结构的分割问题。

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Result: Arbiviewgen首次实现多车辆配置下的可控任意视角图像生成。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动驾驶中的视角生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding

latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and

### [101] [CF3: Compact and Fast 3D Feature Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05254)
*Hyunjoon Lee,Joonkyu Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CF3的3D高斯特征场构建方法，通过自上而下的流程减少计算成本，并优化高斯属性以提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖自下而上的优化过程，将原始2D特征视为真实值，导致计算成本高。

Method: 采用多视图2D特征的快速加权融合，训练高斯级自编码器，并引入自适应稀疏化方法优化高斯属性。

Result: 仅需5%的高斯数量即可实现与Feature-3DGS竞争的结果。

Conclusion: CF3方法在保持几何细节的同时，显著提升了效率和紧凑性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Conclusion: 该方法在心脏手术中实现了高精度实时跟踪，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following
coronary bypass grafting surgery. We can estimate local quantitative
indicators, such as cardiac perfusion, by tracking local feature points.
However, heart motion and significant fluctuations in image characteristics
caused by vessel structural enrichment limit traditional tracking methods. We
propose a particle filtering tracker based on cyclicconsistency checks to
robustly track particles sampled to follow target landmarks. Our method tracks
117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps, allowing real-time estimates during
interventions. It achieves a tracking error of (5.00 +/- 0.22 px) and
outperforms other deep learning trackers (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional
trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).

*Xiaoyang Zhang,Zhen Hua,Yakun Ju,Wei Zhou,Jun Liu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDFuse利用Segment Anything Model（SAM）生成的语义掩码作为显式先验，通过条件扩散模型实现高保真和语义感知的红外与可见光图像融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏对场景的深层语义理解，常无法保留关键目标，且融合过程易引入伪影和细节丢失，影响图像质量和任务性能。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：先初步融合多模态特征，再利用SAM的语义掩码与初步融合图像作为条件，驱动扩散模型进行从粗到细的去噪生成。

Result: SGDFuse在主观和客观评估中均达到最先进性能，且对下游任务适应性强。

Conclusion: SGDFuse为图像融合的核心挑战提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D LiDAR在MLLM中未被充分探索，主要因缺乏高质量标注和适用的模型架构。

Method: 提出B4DL基准、数据生成流程及直接处理原始4D LiDAR的MLLM模型。

Result: 提供了统一的时空推理解决方案，包括数据集和模型输出。

Conclusion: B4DL为动态户外环境中的MLLM研究提供了新工具和方向。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated
dataset, and inference outputs on diverse scenarios at:

*Xiaoyang Zhang,Guodong Fan,Guang-Yong Chen,Zhen Hua,Jinjiang Li,Min Gan,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波变换的双频编码方法（WGDF），用于增强遥感图像中细微变化区域的检测能力，通过结合高频和低频特征提升边缘细节和全局结构的建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间域建模，特征表示多样性有限，难以检测细微变化区域。频率域（尤其是小波域）特征建模可以放大频率分量的细粒度差异，增强边缘变化的感知。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）分解图像为高频和低频成分，分别建模局部细节和全局结构。高频分支设计了双频特征增强模块（DFFE）和频域交互差异模块（FDID），低频分支利用Transformer捕获全局语义关系，并采用渐进上下文差异模块（PCDM）逐步优化变化区域。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上的实验表明，WGDF显著减轻了边缘模糊问题，检测精度和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WGDF通过小波域特征建模和双频特征融合，有效提升了遥感图像变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉语义的抑郁评估方法（VS-LLM），用于自动分析PPAT草图，提升心理状态评估效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPAT草图分析依赖心理学家经验且耗时，需自动化工具支持大规模评估。

Method: 提出VS-LLM方法，结合视觉和语义分析PPAT草图，并建立实验环境。

Result: 实验显示，VS-LLM比心理学家评估方法提升17.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于PPAT草图的心理状态评估研究提供了新工具，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Motivation: 现有高效模型在分布外数据上泛化性能较差，作者旨在解决这一问题，同时保持模型的实时性。

Method: 识别了架构瓶颈和不合理设计，引入Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA)机制，增强局部-全局特征建模。

Result: CoCAViT-28M在ImageNet-1K上达到84.0% top-1准确率，在多个OOD基准测试中表现优异，同时保持低延迟。

Conclusion: CoCAViT在泛化性能和计算效率上取得了显著平衡，适用于实时视觉任务。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: mKG-RAG框架通过引入结构化多模态知识，有效提升了VQA任务的生成质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型预训练视觉语言模型在目标检测任务中表现优异，但在特定目标上仍需微调，而传统微调会丧失原始的自然语言查询和零样本能力。

Method: 采用类似文本反转（TI）的方法，通过学习新的或改进现有词嵌入来扩展VLM词汇表，仅需少量示例即可实现检测，同时保持原始模型权重冻结。

Result: 该方法在多种定量和定性实验中表现优异，匹配或优于基线方法，且计算开销显著低于全模型微调。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了传统微调导致的遗忘问题，同时保留了模型的原始能力，适用于开放词汇目标检测。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat是一种高效且高质量的3D渲染方法，适用于真实和合成场景。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

TL;DR: PriorRG是一个新的胸部X光报告生成框架，通过两阶段训练流程模拟临床工作流，利用患者特定先验知识提升报告质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽略患者特定先验知识（如临床背景和先前图像），导致报告生成无法捕捉诊断意图或疾病进展。

Method: PriorRG采用两阶段训练：1）先验引导的对比预训练，利用临床背景指导特征提取；2）先验感知的粗到细解码，逐步整合先验知识与视觉编码器状态。

Conclusion: PriorRG通过有效利用先验知识，显著提升了胸部X光报告的临床准确性和流畅性。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角定位方法缺乏冗余观测，难以验证定位可靠性。

Method: 将查询图像分割为子图像，估计每个子图像的3-DoF位姿，通过几何刚性公式过滤错误位姿，合并内点生成最终相机位姿。

Result: 在DReSS数据集上，Slice-Loc将平均定位误差从4.47米降至1.86米，方向误差从3.42°降至1.24°。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc通过冗余观测和错误过滤显著提升了跨视角定位的精度和可靠性。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UNCAGE的无训练方法，通过利用注意力图优先解掩码代表单个对象的标记，提高了文本到图像生成的组合保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Masked Generative Transformers在组合文本到图像生成中属性绑定和文本-图像对齐的不足。

Method: 提出UNCAGE方法，利用注意力图指导解掩码过程，优先处理明确代表单个对象的标记。

Result: UNCAGE在多个基准和指标上均表现出性能提升，且推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: UNCAGE是一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，显著提升了组合文本到图像生成的质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有防御机制在检测和修复被投毒图像时面临挑战，可能影响数据效用。TrueBiometric旨在提供更实用、准确和有效的解决方案。

Method: 利用多个先进的视觉语言模型进行多数投票，检测投毒图像，并通过校准的校正噪声修复这些图像。

Result: 实验表明，TrueBiometric能100%准确检测和修复投毒图像，且不影响干净图像的准确性。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric为抵御人脸识别系统中的后门攻击提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度优化的对抗性伪装框架，通过梯度校准和去相关方法解决了物理环境中梯度优化不连续和冲突的问题，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理对抗性伪装对安全关键领域（如自动驾驶）构成威胁，现有方法在多变物理环境中面临梯度优化不连续和冲突的挑战。

Method: 引入梯度校准策略确保梯度更新的连续性，开发梯度去相关方法消除冗余或冲突的更新。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在攻击成功率上显著优于现有技术，平均提升13.46%（距离）和11.03%（角度）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了物理对抗性伪装中的优化问题，同时强调了现实场景中系统设计的鲁棒性需求。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了SmoothSA方法，通过预热冷启动查询和区分视频帧的变换，改进了Slot Attention在对象中心学习中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Slot Attention在图像或视频第一帧中冷启动查询缺乏样本特定信息的问题，以及非第一帧查询需要不同变换的需求。

Method: （1）通过自蒸馏模块预热冷启动查询；（2）区分第一帧和非第一帧的变换，分别使用完整和单次迭代。

Result: 在对象发现、识别和下游任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SmoothSA通过平滑迭代和递归，显著提升了Slot Attention的性能。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

Motivation: 现有的一阶显著性方法无法捕捉视觉语言预训练模型中的复杂跨模态交互，需要更高效且灵活的解释方法。

Method: 提出FIxLIP方法，利用加权Banzhaf交互指数分解相似性，并扩展解释评估指标到二阶交互。

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试中，FIxLIP优于一阶方法，并能有效比较不同模型。

Conclusion: FIxLIP不仅提供高质量的解释，还能用于模型比较，展示了其在视觉语言预训练模型中的实用性。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Flow Matching（FM）的无监督异常检测与定位新范式，通过时间反转FM（rFM）和Worst Transport（WT）位移插值解决传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于流的方法在模型表达能力上存在局限，需要一种更高效的无监督异常检测方法。

Method: 提出时间反转FM（rFM）和WT位移插值，构建非概率演化路径以增强对样本轨迹的动态控制。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上实现了单尺度下的最先进性能。

Conclusion: FM为无监督异常检测提供了理论支持的高效框架，WT-Flow显著提升了异常样本的分离能力。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂体肿瘤常导致周围重要结构变形或包裹，解剖结构分割可为外科医生提供风险区域预警，但缺乏像素级标注的手术视频数据集。

Method: 引入PAS数据集（7,845张图像），采用数据增强技术缓解类别不平衡，并提出F2PASeg模型，结合高分辨率图像特征和深度语义嵌入，提升分割鲁棒性。

Result: F2PASeg能实时一致地分割关键解剖结构，为术中手术规划提供可靠解决方案。

Conclusion: PAS数据集和F2PASeg模型为垂体手术提供了有效的解剖分割工具，增强了手术安全性。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Motivation: 研究有损压缩预处理对对抗性扰动的防御效果，填补全面攻击评估的空白。

Method: 构建强白盒和自适应攻击，评估多种压缩模型在不同攻击场景下的表现。

Result: 高真实感重建的压缩模型对攻击更具抵抗力，而低真实感模型易被攻破。

Conclusion: 高真实感重建图像因其与自然图像的分布对齐而具有固有鲁棒性，为未来对抗性攻击提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于显式知识提示的方法（OND），用于改进预训练基础模型在历史地图语义分割中的表现，并展示了其优于UNet基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图缺乏现代或领域特定图像的规律性，导致预训练基础模型难以直接应用。

Method: 通过引入OND知识提示机制，替换SAM模型的提示编码器，并针对历史地图进行微调，构建SMOL-MapSeg模型。

Result: SMOL-MapSeg能准确分割OND知识定义的类别，并通过少量样本适应新类别，性能优于UNet基线。

Conclusion: OND知识提示机制有效解决了历史地图分割的挑战，为类似问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Conclusion: Manager中心智能体和领域知识库模块对生成高质量IAD解决方案至关重要。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

Motivation: 手性信息在形状分析中普遍存在，但现有形状描述符缺乏对手性信息的捕捉能力，亟需开发一种手性特征提取器。

Method: 基于Diff3F框架，提出了一种无监督的手性特征提取流程，利用2D基础模型为形状顶点添加手性感知信息。

Result: 通过定量和定性实验验证了手性特征的有效性，在下游任务（如左右解耦、形状匹配和部分分割）中表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: 提出的手性特征提取方法在形状分析中具有显著效果和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

TL;DR: MagicHOI提出了一种从单目视频中重建手和物体的方法，解决了传统方法因视角限制导致的物体部分不可见问题，利用新视角合成扩散模型作为先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖物体模板或假设物体完全可见，但在实际场景中，固定视角和静态抓握会导致部分物体不可见，重建结果不真实。

Method: MagicHOI结合新视角合成扩散模型作为先验，通过可见接触约束对齐手和物体，优化未观察到的物体区域。

Result: MagicHOI在3D手-物体重建任务中显著优于现有方法，新视角合成扩散先验有效正则化未观察区域。

Conclusion: MagicHOI通过引入新视角合成扩散先验和接触约束，显著提升了手-物体重建的准确性，尤其在部分物体不可见的情况下。

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

Conclusion: 通过改进外观和运动建模，该方法为多目标跟踪提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Motivation: 解决临床试验数据清理中手动处理效率低、错误率高的问题。

Method: 结合大型语言模型和领域特定启发式方法，开发AI辅助平台Octozi。

Result: AI辅助使数据清理吞吐量提升6.03倍，错误率从54.67%降至8.48%，假阳性查询减少15.48倍。

Conclusion: AI辅助方法可显著提升临床试验效率，降低成本，同时保持合规性，展示了人机协作的潜力。

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构剪枝方法常忽略参数间的相互联系，导致性能下降。

Method: 引入Jacobian Criterion评估参数显著性，并提出Equivalent Pruning机制通过自编码器保留原始连接贡献。

Result: Jacobian Criterion在保持模型性能上优于其他指标，Equivalent Pruning机制有效减少了微调后的性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在结构剪枝中表现出色，兼顾了参数间的相互联系和性能保持。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Motivation: 生成式视频模型的普及使得检测AI生成和操纵视频成为紧迫挑战，现有方法因依赖孤立信息且模型庞大而难以泛化。

Method: SSTGNN通过结构化图表示视频，结合可学习频谱滤波器和时序差分建模，联合推理空间、时序和频谱信息。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，SSTGNN在域内和跨域设置中表现优异，且参数比现有模型少42.4倍。

Conclusion: SSTGNN是一种高效、轻量且可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Method: 研究引入了一个专业标注的多模态、多语言数据集，并对比分析了Gemini、GPT和Llama等MLLMs在品牌安全分类中的表现。

Result: MLLMs在品牌安全分类中表现出色，但在某些情况下仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁进一步研究高效且负责任的内容审核方法，并公开数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Action Discovery的新方法，用于解决部分标注数据集中模糊动作和不完整标注的问题。通过两步法（GGSM和UASA）识别未知动作的时间和语义信息，并在三个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在神经科学等领域，部分动作可能未被标注或定义模糊，导致数据集不完整。本文旨在解决这一问题，提出了一种能够处理已知和未知动作的方法。

Method: 采用两步法：1) Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) 用于识别已知和未知动作的时间区间；2) Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) 用于基于嵌入相似性为未知动作分配语义类别。

Result: 在Breakfast、50Salads和Desktop Assembly三个数据集上，该方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Action Discovery方法有效解决了部分标注数据集中的动作识别问题，为模糊和未标注动作的处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容（AIGC）对高质量、多样化和可扩展数据的需求日益增长，但大规模真实数据收集成本高且耗时，限制了应用发展。

Method: 通过MLLM-Collector收集多模态输入的数据资产和描述，利用MLLM-Generator和MLLM-Optimizer构建3D布局并进行语义优化，最后用MLLM-Planner生成时间连贯的未来帧。

Result: 实验表明，合成数据显著提升了现有基线模型的性能。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction作为一种可扩展且高效的数据引擎，具有推动生成智能发展的潜力。

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

TL;DR: DART框架通过自适应模块增强VLP模型，结合LLM知识提升开放词汇多标签识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLP模型在细粒度定位和类别依赖关系建模上的不足，提升开放词汇多标签识别的性能。

Method: 提出DART框架，包含自适应细化模块（ARM）和自适应转移模块（ATM），结合LLM知识构建类别关系图（CRG）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DART通过自适应模块和外部知识，显著提升了开放词汇多标签识别的效果。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: WeTok是一种新型视觉分词器，通过分组无查找量化和生成解码技术，显著提升了压缩比和重建保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉分词器在压缩比和重建保真度之间难以平衡，WeTok旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分组无查找量化（GQ）和生成解码（GD）技术，分别优化内存计算效率和重建细节。

Result: 在ImageNet 50k验证集上，WeTok实现了最低的零样本rFID（0.12），并在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: WeTok在视觉生成任务中表现卓越，为视觉分词器设定了新标准。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

Motivation: 评估图像与文本的相关性是衡量生成响应质量的关键，但由于文本格式多样且相关性定义场景依赖性强，传统方法难以胜任。MLLM因其灵活性成为理想选择。

Method: LLaVA-RE基于LLaVA架构，结合详细任务指令和多模态上下文样本，构建了一个覆盖多种任务的二进制相关性数据集。

Result: 实验验证了LLaVA-RE框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE为图像-文本相关性评估提供了灵活且有效的解决方案，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: 现有3D内容质量评估方法主要依赖基于图像的指标，且仅关注对象级别，无法全面评估空间一致性、材料真实性和局部细节。

Method: 提出Hi3DEval框架，结合对象级和部分级评估，扩展纹理评估至材料真实性；构建Hi3DBench数据集和多代理标注流程；提出基于混合3D表示的自动评分系统。

Result: 实验表明，Hi3DEval在建模3D特性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于现有基于图像的指标。

Conclusion: Hi3DEval提供了一个可扩展的替代方案，优于传统手动评估方法。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象分割数据集主要包含显著、孤立的对象，限制了在真实场景中的泛化能力。MOSEv2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MOSEv2包含5,024个视频和701,976个高质量掩码，涵盖200个类别的10,074个对象，引入了更复杂的场景和挑战。

Result: 在MOSEv2上，现有方法的性能显著下降（如SAM2从76.4%降至50.9%），表明其在真实场景中的局限性。

Conclusion: MOSEv2为视频对象分割研究提供了更真实的测试平台，揭示了当前方法在复杂场景中的不足。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

Conclusion: GAP成功解决了无色点云到高斯的转换问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer是一种可取消的人脸生成框架，通过混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，保护隐私同时保持识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸匿名化方法未能满足生物特征模板保护的可撤销性、不可链接性和不可逆性要求，FaceAnonyMixer旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型的潜在空间，混合真实人脸与合成代码，并通过多目标损失优化满足生物特征保护要求。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FaceAnonyMixer在商业API上实现了11%以上的隐私保护增益，同时保持高识别准确率。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer在保护隐私的同时，无需修改现有FR系统即可直接匹配，提供了更强的隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

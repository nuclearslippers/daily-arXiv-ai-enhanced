### [1] [Argument Quality Annotation and Gender Bias Detection in Financial Communication through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08262)
*Alaa Alhamzeh,Mays Al Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了GPT-4o、Llama 3.1和Gemma 2三种LLM在金融沟通中标注论据质量的能力，评估了其一致性和对抗性别偏见的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融论据质量评估在文献中研究不足，但其对投资决策和公众信任至关重要。

Method: 使用FinArgQuality数据集，评估LLM标注的多次一致性及对抗性别偏见的攻击实验。

Result: LLM标注的一致性高于人类，但仍存在性别偏见。

Conclusion: 提出了更可靠、经济高效且无偏见的标注方法建议。

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

### [2] [TurQUaz at CheckThat! 2025: Debating Large Language Models for Scientific Web Discourse Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08265)
*Tarık Saraç,Selin Mergen,Mucahid Kutlu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的‘委员会辩论’方法，利用多个大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟学术讨论，以识别推文中的科学主张、科学研究的引用或科学实体的提及。该方法在检测科学研究引用方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过模拟学术讨论的方式，提高对推文中科学内容的识别准确性，尤其是在科学研究的引用方面。

Method: 探索了三种辩论方法：单辩论、团队辩论和委员会辩论。最终选择委员会辩论作为主要模型，因其在开发测试集中表现最优。

Result: 在检测科学主张和科学实体提及方面排名较低（分别为第8和第9），但在检测科学研究引用方面排名第一。

Conclusion: 委员会辩论方法在特定任务（如检测科学研究引用）中表现优异，但在其他任务中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

### [3] [Heartificial Intelligence: Exploring Empathy in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08271)
*Victoria Williams,Benjamin Rosman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在认知共情任务上表现优于人类，但在情感共情上表现较弱，显示出其在虚拟陪伴和情感支持中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在认知和情感共情方面的表现，以评估其作为虚拟伴侣的适用性。

Method: 使用标准化心理测试比较小型（SLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在认知和情感共情上的表现。

Result: LLMs在认知共情任务上优于人类，但在情感共情上显著低于人类。

Conclusion: 语言模型在认知共情上的优势使其适合提供客观的情感支持，而情感共情的不足则避免了情感疲劳或偏见。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

### [4] [Real-time News Story Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08272)
*Tadej Škvorc,Nikola Ivačič,Sebastjan Hribar,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种实时新闻故事识别方法，结合文本表示、聚类和在线主题建模技术，用于新闻监控系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升新闻阅读体验，通过自动将新闻文章归类到特定故事中，帮助用户更好地跟踪事件发展。

Method: 结合文本表示技术、聚类算法和在线主题建模方法（如BERTopic、DBStream、TextClust），提取事件和命名实体以实现故事识别。

Result: 在斯洛文尼亚媒体数据集上评估，人类评价显示该方法能产生合理结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实现实时新闻故事识别，适用于新闻监控系统。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

### [5] [TT-XAI: Trustworthy Clinical Text Explanations via Keyword Distillation and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08273)
*Kristian Miok,Blaz Škrlj,Daniela Zaharie,Marko Robnik Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TT-XAI是一个轻量级框架，通过关键词蒸馏和LLM推理提升临床语言模型的分类性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床语言模型在处理长文本电子健康记录时预测和解释不可靠的问题。

Method: 1. 通过关键词蒸馏简化文本；2. 使用关键词引导的提示生成临床解释。

Result: 关键词蒸馏显著提升了分类性能和解释质量，并通过多种评估验证其有效性。

Conclusion: TT-XAI为临床决策支持提供了可扩展且可信赖的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

### [6] [Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models: A Concept Bottleneck Model for Hate and Counter Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08274)
*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Djordje Slijepčević,Xihui Chen,Adrian Jaques Böck,Andreas Babic,Liz Freimann,Christiane Atzmüller Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种透明的方法（SCBM），利用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，通过大语言模型（LLMs）映射文本到形容词表示，再通过轻量级分类器进行仇恨和反仇恨言论识别。在五个数据集上表现优异，且具有高解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上仇恨言论的快速增长对社会产生了前所未有的影响，需要自动化的检测方法。现有黑盒模型缺乏解释性，因此提出透明方法。

Method: 使用形容词作为瓶颈概念，通过LLMs将文本映射到形容词表示，再用轻量级分类器进行下游任务。结合Transformer嵌入可提升性能。

Result: 在五个多语言和多平台数据集上，SCBM平均macro-F1得分为0.69，优于文献中的最新结果。结合Transformer嵌入后性能提升1.8%。

Conclusion: 形容词为基础的概念表示是紧凑、可解释且有效的编码方法，适用于仇恨和反仇恨言论识别，并可扩展到其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

### [7] [MLLM-CBench:A Comprehensive Benchmark for Continual Instruction Tuning of Multimodal LLMs with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08275)
*Haiyun Guo,ZhiYan Hou,Yu Chen,Jinghan He,Yandu Sun,Yuzhe Zhou,Shujing Guo,Kuan Zhu,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CTBench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型持续指令调优的综合性基准，包含多维评估、算法比较和任务设计，揭示了模型能力、任务顺序和算法选择对持续学习效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏系统性的评估基准，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的持续指令调优进展受限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出MLLM-CTBench基准，结合最终答案准确性和细粒度推理质量评估，比较八种持续学习算法和两种训练范式，并精选16个数据集。

Result: 发现模型通用能力越强，遗忘越少；推理链退化慢于最终答案；算法效果依赖模型能力和任务顺序；KL约束在强化学习中有效。

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench为持续指令调优提供了严格标准和实用指导，推动了算法设计和评估的进步。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

### [8] [Evaluating Contrast Localizer for Identifying Causal Unitsin Social & Mathematical Tasks in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08276)
*Yassine Jamaa,Badr AlKhamissi,Satrajit Ghosh,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过神经科学对比定位器，在大语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）中定位与心理理论（ToM）和数学推理任务因果相关的单元。结果发现，低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，且数学定位器提取的单元对ToM任务的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs和VLMs中ToM和数学推理任务的因果相关单元，验证对比定位器的有效性。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，并通过针对性消融评估其因果作用。比较功能选择单元、低激活单元和随机选择单元对下游任务准确性的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大；数学定位器提取的单元对ToM任务的影响超过ToM定位器提取的单元。

Conclusion: 对比定位器的因果相关性存疑，需更广泛的刺激集和更精确的任务特定单元捕捉方法。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

### [9] [Objective Metrics for Evaluating Large Language Models Using External Data Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08277)
*Haoze Du,Richard Li,Edward Gehringer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用主观指标评估大语言模型（LLM）性能的框架，强调自动化、透明性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免主观评估的局限性，提供一致、可重复且偏差最小化的性能测量方法。

Method: 利用不同学期的文本材料生成主观指标，结合基准测试和结构化评估流程。

Result: 实现了自动化、透明的评分，减少了对人工解释的依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法为教育和科学等领域提供了可扩展的性能评估解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet
challenging task, particularly when aiming to avoid subjective assessments.
This paper proposes a framework for leveraging subjective metrics derived from
the class textual materials across different semesters to assess LLM outputs
across various tasks. By utilizing well-defined benchmarks, factual datasets,
and structured evaluation pipelines, the approach ensures consistent,
reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements. The framework emphasizes
automation and transparency in scoring, reducing reliance on human
interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This
method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a
scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and
other high-stakes domains.

### [10] [MinionsLLM: a Task-adaptive Framework For The Training and Control of Multi-Agent Systems Through Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08283)
*Andres Garcia Rincon,Eliseo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinionsLLM框架结合LLMs、行为树和形式语法，通过自然语言控制多智能体系统，提供标准化接口和两种数据集生成方法，显著提升语法有效性和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中自然语言控制的挑战，提供灵活且标准化的解决方案。

Method: 结合LLMs、行为树和形式语法，引入两种数据集生成方法（Method A和Method B）优化LLMs。

Result: Method B将语法有效性提升至92.6%，任务性能平均提高33%，小模型受益最大。

Conclusion: MinionsLLM为资源受限场景提供了高效解决方案，并开源框架以支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Albert Sawczyn,Bogdan Gabrys,Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出ROUGE作为幻觉检测评估指标与人类判断不一致，提出需采用语义感知的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题影响可靠性，现有评估方法（如ROUGE）与人类判断不匹配，需改进。

Method: 通过人类研究对比ROUGE与LLM-as-Judge等人类对齐指标，分析简单启发式方法的有效性。

Result: ROUGE召回率高但精度极低，复杂检测方法性能下降达45.9%，简单启发式方法效果相当。

Conclusion: 需采用语义感知的评估框架，以准确衡量幻觉检测方法性能，确保LLM输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

### [12] [Sacred or Synthetic? Evaluating LLM Reliability and Abstention for Religious Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08287)
*Farah Atif,Nursultan Askarbekuly,Kareem Darwish,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为FiqhQA的新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在伊斯兰教法裁决中的表现，特别是针对四大逊尼派法学派别的阿拉伯语和英语回答。研究发现，不同模型在准确性、语言和法学派别上表现差异显著，GPT-4o准确性最高，而Gemini和Fanar在避免错误回答方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多个领域中被广泛用于回答问题，但其在宗教领域（尤其是伊斯兰教法）的可靠性和准确性尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过FiqhQA基准，对LLMs在伊斯兰教法裁决中的表现进行评估，重点关注其准确性和避免回答的能力（abstention behavior）。实验采用零样本和避免回答测试。

Result: GPT-4o在准确性上表现最佳，而Gemini和Fanar在避免错误回答方面更优。所有模型在阿拉伯语中的表现均下降，突显了非英语语言在宗教推理中的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在宗教应用中需对LLMs进行任务特定评估和谨慎部署的必要性，尤其是在涉及细粒度法学派别裁决时。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

### [13] [Putnam-AXIOM: A Functional and Static Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08292)
*Aryan Gulati,Brando Miranda,Eric Chen,Emily Xia,Kai Fronsdal,Bruno Dumont,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Putnam-AXIOM基准，用于评估大型语言模型在高级数学推理上的表现，并通过动态生成问题避免训练集污染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理基准已接近饱和且易受训练集污染影响，需要更动态、抗污染的评估方法。

Method: 使用Putnam竞赛问题构建基准，并通过程序化扰动生成变体问题，提出Teacher-Forced Accuracy（TFA）评分方法。

Result: 最强模型在原始问题上准确率为41.9%，但在变体问题上下降19.6%，表明模型存在记忆现象。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM为评估高级数学推理提供了动态、抗污染的框架，并公开了数据和代码。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

*Shuzhou Yuan,William LaCroix,Hardik Ghoshal,Ercong Nie,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDAE框架通过Chain-of-Thought数据增强优化LLMs在教育场景中的表现，提升其教学适应性和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现成LLMs在教育中表现不佳的问题，如过早揭示答案、缺乏适应性及易受情绪操控。

Method: 收集真实师生对话，用CoT提示增强数据，设计针对性案例以解决三大限制，并微调开源LLMs。

Result: 微调后的模型在教学指导、推理支持和抗干扰方面表现更优。

Conclusion: CoDAE能有效提升LLMs在教育场景中的适用性和教学效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

TL;DR: Mol-R1框架通过PRID和MoIA策略提升长链思维推理模型在分子生成任务中的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在知识密集型领域（如分子发现）中表现不佳，需要改进其推理能力和效率。

Method: 使用PRID策略生成高质量推理数据集，结合MoIA训练策略（SFT与RPO迭代结合）优化模型。

Result: Mol-R1在文本分子生成任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mol-R1有效提升了长链思维推理模型在分子生成任务中的性能，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance

*Saketh Reddy Vemula,Dipti Mishra Sharma,Parameswari Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，形态对齐对语言模型性能有适度正面影响，但分词算法（如BPE与Unigram）对下游任务表现影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨形态对齐的分词方法是否提升语言模型性能，特别是针对形态复杂的语言。

Method: 选择多种语言（Telugu、Hindi、English），从分词训练到下游任务评估全面测试，分析形态对齐和分词质量的影响。

Result: 形态对齐与句法任务表现呈适度正相关，但分词算法（Unigram优于BPE）影响更大。混合分词方法在BPE框架中表现更优。

Conclusion: 分词算法比形态对齐更关键，混合方法在特定框架中表现突出，内在指标与下游任务无关。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种轻量级DPO变体（Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero），通过引入基于边界的优化目标和选择性更新机制，改善小型LLM在性能差距下的对齐问题。APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval和MT-Bench中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型LLM在性能差距下难以对齐人类偏好，需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 提出两种DPO变体：Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero，结合边界目标和选择性更新机制。

Result: APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval中提升胜率2.0点，长度控制胜率1.4点；在MT-Bench中表现优异，尤其在STEM和人文任务中。

Conclusion: 简单修改偏好目标可显著提升小型LLM的对齐效果，为资源受限场景提供实用方案。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

TL;DR: 论文通过物理学方法研究大型语言模型在推理过程中隐藏状态的变化，发现类似能量的量在模型间几乎恒定，并提出一种控制方法Jacobian steering。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是理解语言模型内部隐藏状态的动态变化，并探索如何通过物理学视角提高模型的可解释性和可控性。

Method: 分析了20个开源Transformer模型，提出“能量”概念，并基于此开发了Jacobian steering控制方法。

Result: 发现随机权重模型比预训练模型更严格地保持“能量”恒定，Jacobian steering方法在语义质量上优于自然输出。

Conclusion: 物理学视角为语言模型的可解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供了理论基础，有助于模型更符合人类意图。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型（LLM）对齐方法（如RLHF）仅能反映平均用户偏好，无法捕捉多样化需求。

Method: 采用少样本比较回归方法，结合上下文学习和细粒度属性，比较响应选项并做出对齐选择。

Result: 提出的方法在可引导多元化基准测试中优于基线方法和现有技术，适用于价值对齐决策和奖励建模。

Conclusion: 该研究为多元化对齐提供了新思路，推动了伦理AI的发展，使LLM的使用更公平和具代表性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过压缩令牌表示来节省计算资源，同时保持下游任务性能。

Method: 使用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，通过去噪学习生成压缩表示，并优化编码器以最大化压缩质量。

Result: 在2倍压缩下性能接近未压缩模型，8倍压缩时性能下降较小，适用于问答、摘要和多向量检索任务。

Conclusion: DeCAL在预计算密集表示场景中节省显著，未来可进一步扩展应用范围。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症预测因缺乏高质量标注数据集而受限，研究旨在通过DepressLLM解决这一问题。

Method: 使用3,699篇自传体叙事训练DepressLLM，引入SToPS模块提升性能，并在多种数据集上验证。

Result: AUC达0.789，高置信度样本AUC提升至0.904，模型在异质数据中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 可解释AI有望实现抑郁症早期诊断，未来需进一步优化模型和数据。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

TL;DR: 综述探讨了参数高效微调（PEFT）在优化检索增强生成（RAG）系统中的应用，重点分析了低秩适应（LoRA）方法。研究发现动态和集成LoRA适配在减少参数量的同时保持了性能，但在低资源语言（如粤语）的细粒度表达上仍有局限。

Motivation: 解决RAG系统在低资源语言（如粤语）中因数据稀缺和语言变异性导致的生成和检索挑战。

Method: 评估了LoRA在RAG框架中的集成，比较了不同PEFT方法，分析了合成数据生成、用户反馈和自适应参数分配等技术。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA适配显著减少了可训练参数，同时保持了检索和生成质量，但在细粒度语言表达上仍有不足。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在领域特定语言任务中具有潜力，未来需关注方言真实性、动态适配和可扩展性。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

Conclusion: 任务规模扩展（task scaling）是提升推理能力的关键，为通用推理模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Motivation: 现有移动代理方法仅关注显式意图流（如步骤序列），而忽略了隐式意图流（如个人偏好），难以构建个性化代理。

Method: 提出IFRAgent框架，通过分析显式意图流构建标准操作程序库，分析隐式意图流构建用户习惯库，结合检索增强生成和查询重写生成个性化查询和操作。

Conclusion: IFRAgent通过显式和隐式意图流的结合，显著提升了移动代理与人类意图的对齐能力。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

Result: TopXGen显著提升了LLMs在微调和上下文学习中的翻译性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen为低资源语言翻译提供了一种有效的数据生成方法，提升了LLMs的性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能让LLMs模仿浅层和不稳定的风格模式，无法精确且一致地体现所需特质。

Method: 基于心理学理论，自动生成并优化包含自我感知经验的文本自我反思，通过信息论目标迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，IROTE能稳定诱导LLMs在多样化任务中模仿目标特质，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IROTE通过自我反思优化，解决了LLMs特质表现的表层激发问题，实现了稳定和可转移的特质激发。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Magical的非对称LoRA架构，用于解决多源异构医学通俗语言生成（MLLG）任务中语义保真和多样化风格生成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA方法在多源异构MLLG数据集中表现不佳，无法满足语义保真和多样化风格生成的需求。

Method: Magical采用共享矩阵A进行抽象摘要，多个独立矩阵B用于多样化风格生成，并引入语义不变约束和推荐引导切换机制。

Result: 实验表明，Magical在三个真实数据集上优于现有方法，同时减少了31.66%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: Magical为异构数据场景下的MLLG任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是首个专门评估RAG-LLMs中重排序器的基准测试，为未来研究提供了有价值的指导和观察。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐私保护的RAG框架ARoG，通过关系中心抽象和结构导向抽象策略解决匿名实体检索问题，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在RAG系统中因使用私有知识图谱（KGs）而引发的隐私风险，同时克服匿名实体导致的语义丢失问题。

Method: 提出ARoG框架，包含关系中心抽象（动态捕捉相邻关系语义）和结构导向抽象（将问题转化为结构化路径）策略。

Result: 在三个数据集上验证，ARoG表现出色且隐私鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: ARoG有效解决了隐私保护的RAG问题，同时提升了检索性能。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化环境构建流程和可验证奖励机制，显著提升大语言模型的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在工具使用方面效率不足，缺乏稳定的训练环境和可验证的奖励机制。

Method: 设计了自动化环境构建流程（包括场景分解、文档生成等）和可验证奖励机制，结合标准RL算法进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型的工具使用能力，且不影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过改进上下文理解和推理能力，模型在工具使用方面取得了显著进步。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

TL;DR: 论文提出TiMoE模型，通过分时段预训练和因果路由解决大语言模型知识过时问题，减少时间泄漏错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因训练数据固定导致知识过时和时间泄漏的问题。

Method: 预训练多个GPT风格的专家模型，分别针对不同时间段的数据，通过TiMoE（时间感知混合专家模型）在推理时屏蔽未来信息，确保因果有效性。

Result: TiMoE在多个NLP任务中表现优异，减少未来知识错误达15%。

Conclusion: 分时段预训练和因果路由是保持语言模型时间有效性且不牺牲性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法无法全面评估LLMs对非数学扰动的敏感性，需更准确的方法衡量其数学推理能力。

Method: 通过数学等价但语言和参数变化的题目测试LLMs，创建PutnamGAP数据集，评估18种模型的性能。

Result: 模型在变体题目上表现显著下降，如O3在核心步骤变体上下降10.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有效揭示了LLMs的鲁棒性不足，为改进数学推理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛应用中表现出意识形态偏见，尤其是政治和经济维度，需要一种方法来探测和减轻这些偏见。

Method: 使用对比对提取和比较隐藏层激活（如Mistral和DeepSeek模型），并引入全面的激活提取流程，进行分层分析。

Result: 研究发现解码器LLMs在层次上系统性地编码了表示偏见，可通过导向向量有效减轻。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LLMs中政治偏见的编码方式，并提供了一种超越表层干预的去偏见方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Motivation: 理解LLM权重中的偏见和刻板印象对制定有效缓解策略至关重要，但偏见行为难以隔离和分析。

Result: BiasGym能有效减少现实刻板印象（如‘某国人鲁莽驾驶’）并探索虚构关联（如‘某国人蓝皮肤’）。

Conclusion: BiasGym为安全干预和可解释性研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射学报告质量评估依赖资深医生，成本高且可能因主观因素导致评分不准确。

Method: Sqator通过分析初级与资深报告间的修订文本跨度（span），计算修订的重要性并合并为最终评分。

Result: 在12,013份放射学报告上的实验表明，Sqator评分与资深医生判断一致且具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Sqator能有效替代人工评估，降低成本并提高评分准确性。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Result: 实验发现LLMs内部存在西方主导偏见和文化扁平化，低资源文化因训练数据有限而偏见较少。

Conclusion: 为未来减少文化偏见和提升LLMs文化理解的研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

Result: 在多个任务中，ASPD实现了最高3.19倍的速度提升，且生成质量差异小于1%。

Conclusion: ASPD为高效LLM并行推理设定了新标准，适用于延迟敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Motivation: 评估语言模型在低资源语言中的多步推理能力，填补英语以外语言的研究空白。

Method: 通过手动翻译英语Reveal数据集创建孟加拉语版本，对比英语和孟加拉语多语言小模型的表现。

Result: 推理上下文对非二元问题有益，但模型难以有效利用孟加拉语推理步骤。

Conclusion: 不同模型和语言在推理步骤利用上存在差异，需进一步研究低资源语言的推理能力。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法优于固定预算基线，准确率和token效率显著提升。

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

TL;DR: LoDIT是一种通过利用特定标记logits在生成过程中联合生成并忠实归因答案的方法，显著提升了RAG中的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）表现优异，但其幻觉问题严重影响了可信度。现有方法在直接对齐标记生成与归因生成方面存在局限性。

Method: LoDIT通过两步实现：(1) 用特定标记标识文档并利用这些标记的logits估计文档对答案的贡献；(2) 将这些贡献聚合为文档归因。

Result: 在Trust-Align基准测试中，LoDIT在多个指标上显著优于现有最优模型，且具有低延迟和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LoDIT在提升生成答案的可信度和效率方面表现出色，为LLMs的可信度问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

TL;DR: RetroAttention是一种新型KV缓存更新技术，通过修正累积的注意力错误，提升长上下文任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文任务中，KV缓存的内存占用和延迟问题限制了LLMs的性能，现有方法未能解决解码过程中的累积注意力错误。

Method: 提出RetroAttention技术，通过轻量级输出缓存修正过去的注意力输出，利用后续解码步骤的新KV条目。

Result: 在长生成基准测试中，RetroAttention显著优于现有KV压缩方法，有效KV暴露提升1.6倍，准确率提高21.9%。

Conclusion: RetroAttention突破了固定注意力输出范式，为长上下文任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Conclusion: 零样本代码生成是表格问答的有效方法，无需任务特定训练即可实现一定性能。

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖资源密集的微调（FT），可能导致知识退化且适应性受限，而TF方法提供了一种无需重训练的高效替代方案。

Method: 将TF对齐方法分为解码前、解码中和解码后三个阶段，详细分析其机制及在LLM和多模态LLM（MLLM）中的应用。

Result: 总结了TF对齐方法的优势与局限性，并指出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: TF对齐方法为LLM的安全性和可靠性提供了新途径，未来需进一步解决其挑战以实现更广泛应用。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Motivation: 直接应用LLM于患者治疗场景存在伦理和安全问题，因此转向开发LLM作为监督者培训治疗师。

Result: 实验表明，基于MATE数据集微调的模型能根据临床指南提供高质量反馈。

Conclusion: 该方法在治疗师培训场景中显示出显著潜力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

Motivation: LLM的推理过程因自回归特性难以加速，影响高效部署。现有方法多依赖额外训练，而READER旨在无需训练即可提升效率。

Method: READER结合自重复文本和统计搜索扩展推测解码树，优化KV缓存，适用于大批量任务。

Result: READER在推测解码方法中表现最佳，速度提升超40%，在检索增强生成任务中实现10倍加速。

Conclusion: READER为LLM推理提供高效、无需训练的解决方案，特别适合工业应用中的大批量任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法在主观任务中面临主观评价标准和不稳定奖励信号的挑战，而人类评价结合了显式标准和隐式比较判断。

Method: 提出CPO方法，采用组级比较评分；引入CharacterArena评估框架，包括多轮角色扮演模拟和轨迹级比较评估。

Result: 在CharacterEval、CharacterBench和CharacterArena上的实验表明，CPO有效减少奖励模糊性，显著提升对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO通过比较评分范式改善了主观任务的奖励建模，CharacterArena框架提供了更稳健和公平的评估。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

Motivation: 解决LLM在低资源语言上性能下降的问题，避免依赖多语言数据。

Method: 采用全局Softmax权重和Transformer Softmax模型，融合所有中间层信息，映射到LLM嵌入空间。

Result: 在多个任务中显著优于基线，如Sinhala分类准确率提升至75.86%，XNLI平均准确率提升至71.50%。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展且数据高效的方法，提升多语言LLM的能力和公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过领域适配和推理能力增强的最先进CDCR模型可以有效提升过程工业中数据质量和日志记录的连通性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列为多语言代码生成任务提供有价值的资源，推动社区关注更具挑战性和实用性的场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

Method: 提出了OdysseyBench，包含两个任务集（OdysseyBench+和OdysseyBench-Neo），并开发了HomerAgents框架来自动生成长期工作流基准测试。

Result: OdysseyBench能有效挑战现有LLM代理，提供更准确的复杂场景能力评估。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench是推动LLM代理在现实生产力场景中发展和评估的重要资源。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在逻辑丰富指令上的表现，填补研究空白。

Method: 提出LogicIFGen框架生成可验证指令，构建LogicIFEval基准测试。

Result: 当前LLMs在LogicIFEval上表现不佳，仅能遵循不到60%的指令。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂逻辑指令遵循能力上仍有显著不足。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在生成文本时存在的时间振荡现象，并提出两种利用时间一致性的方法：Temporal Self-Consistency Voting和Temporal Consistency Reinforcement，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解码策略丢弃了丰富的中间预测，而研究发现正确结果常出现在中间步骤但被后续去噪步骤覆盖，因此需要利用时间动态性提升模型表现。

Method: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting：训练无关的解码策略，聚合去噪步骤的预测；2) Temporal Consistency Reinforcement：使用Temporal Semantic Entropy（TSE）作为奖励信号，鼓励稳定生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，单独使用TSE奖励在Countdown数据集上平均提升24.7%；结合准确率奖励，在GSM8K、MATH500、SVAMP和Countdown上分别提升2.0%、4.3%、6.6%和25.3%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了dLLMs中时间动态性的潜力，并提供了两种简单有效的工具来利用这一潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在功能基序表示学习上的局限性，更准确地预测药物相互作用。

Method: 将分子分解为功能基序，结合全局分子图像信息，使用Transformer编码器和自适应特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于现有方法，且在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过全局和局部结构表示，显著提升了药物相互作用预测的性能。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

Motivation: 由于物联网（IoT）设备数量激增且计算能力有限，部署深度学习OD模型面临挑战，而现有研究未充分解决TinyML环境中的优化问题。

Conclusion: 论文为边缘人工智能部署提供了实用指导，并建立了公共仓库以跟踪该领域的快速发展。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的流程，用于优化混合光学神经网络（ONNs），通过Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation（NTKD）缩小精度差距，并在多个数据集和硬件配置上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONNs）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有能效优势，但其应用受限于训练精度差距和仿真与实物系统间的差异。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的流程，包括预训练精度估计和NTKD方法，用于训练和微调数字后端。

Result: 在多个数据集和硬件配置上，该流程显著提升了ONNs性能，支持实际部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为混合光学神经网络的优化和实际应用提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，用于生成长序列视频叙事，解决了现有框架在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量不佳和表现力有限的问题。

Method: MAViS通过多阶段协作（如脚本编写、镜头设计等）和3E原则（探索、检查、增强）优化生成过程，并提出脚本编写指南以适配生成工具。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力上达到最优，并能生成多模态设计输出（视频、叙事和背景音乐）。

Conclusion: MAViS是一个模块化、可扩展的框架，能够通过简短用户提示生成高质量的长序列视频叙事。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装扩散框架，通过联合建模上下服装和个人身份，解决了现有虚拟试衣方法在真实性和灵活性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法通常分开处理上下服装，依赖繁重预处理，且难以保留个人特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），导致真实感和灵活性受限。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：Garment Representation Module（GRM）捕捉服装语义，Person Representation Module（PRM）编码身份和姿态，A-DiT融合模块通过扩散变压器整合服装、个人和文本提示特征。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为真实世界的虚拟试衣应用提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉需要将像素分组为对象并理解其空间关系（横向和深度）。CObL旨在通过对象层堆栈表示场景，以捕捉遮挡顺序和对象完成。

Method: 使用扩散架构CObL，生成并行的对象层堆栈，利用Stable Diffusion作为先验，并通过推理时指导确保层复合回输入图像。训练数据为合成多对象桌面场景图像。

Result: CObL零样本泛化到真实世界照片，能重建多个遮挡对象，无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量。

Conclusion: CObL在无监督对象中心表示学习中表现出色，不局限于训练环境，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

Method: 研究采用多模态注释协议、跨模态相似性分析和检索增强评估方法，对Re:Zero漫画的308个标注面板进行了系统评估，涵盖生成式叙事、上下文对话基础和时间推理三个核心维度。

Result: 研究发现当前模型缺乏真正的故事级智能，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和长序列因果推理方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估叙事智能提供了基础和方法论，同时为多模态模型在离散视觉叙事中的深层理解能力提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需侵入模型内部，适用于各种VLM服务模式，且在安全性和隐蔽性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM行为控制方法（如系统提示或激活向量）易检测或需侵入模型内部，VISOR旨在通过视觉输入实现高效且隐蔽的行为控制。

Method: VISOR通过设计通用引导图像，诱导目标激活模式，仅需视觉输入即可实现行为控制。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上验证，VISOR在拒绝、奉承和生存本能任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像即可实现显著行为偏移（高达25%），且不影响其他任务性能。

Conclusion: VISOR为多模态模型控制提供了新思路，同时揭示了视觉引导攻击的安全漏洞，呼吁开发针对性的防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日语文献转录任务繁重且标注数据稀缺，限制了OCR系统的训练效果。

Method: 引入平行文本行图像，提出基于欧几里得距离和最大均值差异（MMD）的目标函数，优化自注意力特征。

Result: 字符错误率分别降低2.23%（欧几里得距离）和3.94%（MMD），自注意力表示质量提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了历史文献OCR性能，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CalAttn的模块，通过学习每个实例的自适应温度来改进Vision Transformers的概率校准，显著降低了校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要。传统的全局温度缩放方法需要验证集且适应性不足。

Method: 引入Calibration Attention (CalAttn)，直接从ViT的CLS标记学习每个实例的自适应温度。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低至多4倍，且仅增加不到0.1%的参数。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，不牺牲准确性，提供了更可信的概率校准。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注数据有限和领域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法通常针对单一任务，导致性能不佳。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net框架，包含一个学生模型和两个多样化教师模型，结合数据增强和标签传播技术。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架在多种半监督学习场景中表现出潜力。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

TL;DR: FLIPNET通过两种模式（修复和退化）解决盲脸修复中的扩散先验与真实场景的差距，提升修复效果和退化模拟能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散先验在盲脸修复中存在与真实场景的差距，主要源于高质量与低质量图像、合成与真实图像的差异。

Method: FLIPNET采用统一网络，切换修复模式（整合BFR特征和面部嵌入）和退化模式（模拟真实退化）。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FLIPNET在修复真实性和退化模拟方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FLIPNET有效解决了扩散先验在盲脸修复中的适应性问题，提升了修复和退化模拟的性能。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Motivation: 现有算法因训练数据少难以捕捉通用视觉表示，且SAM等视觉基础模型无法定位关键解剖点，需结合分割与定位任务以符合临床指南。

Method: 提出AutoSAME框架，结合SAM的分割能力与关键点定位任务，引入FCBA和SGPA优化特征表示和提示嵌入生成。

Result: 在超声心动图数据集上验证了AutoSAME在分割、关键点定位和指标测量中的高效性和优越性。

Conclusion: AutoSAME通过结合分割与定位任务，优化视觉表示，显著提升了LV指标测量的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Result: 在多种数据集上显著优于基线，定量和定性结果均有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法无需标注即可有效应对复杂虚假相关性，提升领域泛化能力。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Conclusion: 该框架为生成灵活可控的高质量人体视频提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在文档理解中表现出色，但其推理过程不透明，难以在高风险领域（如法律、金融、医疗）中确保可靠性和可信度。现有方法存在灾难性遗忘、适应性差和领域任务泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: DocThinker采用基于规则的强化学习（RL）框架，动态优化推理策略，生成可解释的中间结果（如结构化推理过程、重述问题、支持答案的兴趣区域和最终答案），并通过多目标规则奖励和KL约束优化提升性能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DocThinker显著提高了泛化能力，并生成更可解释和人类可理解的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习是提升MLLM文档理解可解释性和适应性的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

TL;DR: QueryCraft框架通过引入语义先验和特征学习，改进了HOI检测中的查询初始化问题，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR-based方法在HOI检测中因查询缺乏明确语义导致性能不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出QueryCraft框架，结合ACTOR和PDQD模块，通过跨模态Transformer和感知蒸馏优化查询初始化。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义引导的查询初始化显著提升了HOI检测效果。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型规模和复杂度的增加，微调成本高昂，需要一种高效的方法将‘弱’模型的适应知识迁移到‘强’模型上。

Method: TransMiter通过无监督方式捕捉预训练和微调模型之间的知识差距，训练后可跨模型迁移，且仅需少量层，推理成本低。

Result: 实验表明，TransMiter能高效迁移适应知识，保持泛化能力，并在少量标注数据下性能超越微调的强模型。

Conclusion: TransMiter是一种高效、轻量的适配器，适用于不同规模和架构的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习有效提升了手持视频去模糊的性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Motivation: 现有VIS方法假设对象类别固定且容易遗忘旧类别，无法适应新类别的持续学习。

Method: HVPL通过帧级和视频级提示学习，结合正交梯度校正（OGC）模块和视频上下文解码器，减少遗忘。

Result: HVPL在实验中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HVPL有效解决了VIS中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Conclusion: AME是一种即插即用的模块，适用于多种视觉-语言蒸馏框架，并能通过理论分析证明其泛化误差更小。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态医学图像融合方法MMIF-AMIN，通过可逆密集网络和多尺度互补特征提取模块，有效提取独特和互补特征，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态医学图像融合（MMIF）需要整合不同模态的图像以提供更全面的诊断信息，但如何同时捕捉独特和互补信息是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出MMIF-AMIN方法，使用可逆密集网络（IDN）进行无损特征提取，设计多尺度互补特征提取模块（MCFEM）结合混合注意力机制和Transformer，并引入自适应损失函数。

Result: 实验表明MMIF-AMIN在定量和定性分析中优于九种现有方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性，且在其他图像融合任务中也表现良好。

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN通过创新的架构和自适应损失函数，显著提升了多模态医学图像融合的性能，并展示了良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

TL;DR: PADReg提出了一种基于接触力的物理感知变形配准框架，用于超声图像配准，显著提升了配准精度和解剖对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像的低对比度、高噪声和模糊组织边界使得变形配准极具挑战性，现有方法缺乏物理可解释性和解剖对齐能力。

Method: PADReg利用机器人超声系统测量的接触力作为物理先验，构建像素级刚度图，结合力数据通过轻量级物理感知模块估计变形场。

Result: 实验表明，PADReg的HD95为12.90，比现有方法提升了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过引入物理先验，实现了更准确的超声图像配准，具有更好的解剖对齐和物理可解释性。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ROD的新型RGB-only方法，用于越野自由空间检测，消除了对LiDAR数据的依赖，提高了推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于越野场景中可通行区域的边界模糊，现有方法依赖多模态融合（RGB和LiDAR），但计算表面法线图会增加推理时间，不适合实时应用。

Method: 利用预训练的Vision Transformer（ViT）从RGB图像中提取丰富特征，并设计轻量高效的解码器。

Result: ROD在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新的SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS，显著优于先前模型。

Conclusion: ROD通过RGB-only方法实现了高效且实时的越野自由空间检测，解决了多模态方法的计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

Motivation: 高清晰度视频压缩中的带状伪影严重影响观看体验，现有数据集仅限于静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态。

Method: 创建了LIVE-YT-Banding数据集，包含160个AV1压缩视频，并开发了基于深度神经网络的无参考评估模型CBAND。

Result: CBAND在带状伪影预测性能上显著优于现有方法，且速度更快，还可作为可微分损失函数优化视频去带状伪影模型。

Conclusion: CBAND和LIVE-YT-Banding数据集为视频质量评估和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了罕见案例相关的错误，提升了模型鲁棒性且未引入新问题。

Conclusion: 提出的目标修复策略有效提升了模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度分割网络对所有像素平等加权，忽略了透镜结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的分割校准问题。

Method: 提出ACW损失，将透镜结构子区域按置信度分组，并设计自适应置信度阈值优化算法和边界预期校准误差（BECE）指标。

Result: 在临床数据集上，ACW显著优于其他方法，IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW方法有效利用了专家标注的置信度先验，显著提升了透镜结构分割的准确性和校准性。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available
at https://github.com/XiaoLing12138/Adaptive-Confidence-Wise-Loss.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟社交媒体视频共享管道的框架，用于生成压缩视频数据，以改进深度伪造检测器的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台对视频的专有压缩导致深度伪造检测器在真实场景中表现不佳，而直接模拟这些压缩过程存在技术限制。

Method: 通过估计少量上传视频的压缩和调整参数，构建本地模拟器，生成大规模模拟数据。

Result: 实验表明模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，且检测器在模拟数据上微调后性能接近真实数据训练的结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为实验室训练与真实部署之间的差距提供了可扩展的解决方案，尤其在压缩视频领域。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检索系统在简单场景中表现良好，但在复杂、模糊的真实场景中效果有限，因此需要更强大的基准。

Method: ROOMELSA通过全景房间图像中的特定区域和自然语言查询，从大型数据库中检索对应的3D模型。

Result: 尽管粗粒度检索已解决，但只有少数模型能在所有测试案例中表现优异；CLIP模型表现良好但存在细节错误。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA为提升真实世界3D识别系统提供了新基准，强调了视觉与语言理解的紧密结合。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Motivation: 动物姿态估计因物种形态多样性和标注数据有限而更具挑战性，现有方法难以应对复杂场景。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过融合生成模型和语义先验，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Motivation: 传统均匀锐化强度忽略了纹理变化，降低了视频质量，同时增加了比特率，缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Result: 在基准测试中，模型在质量和比特率节省方面均表现出色。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp是一种有效的端到端区域自适应视频锐化模型。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 在ZJU-MoCap和MonoCap数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了更好的关节对齐、纹理保真度和结构连续性。

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF在复杂姿态和遮挡条件下显著提升了渲染质量。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式能有效提升现有方法的性能，且无需额外架构改动，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的方法在多概念生成时存在身份丢失和特征泄漏问题，主要原因是令牌间干扰和空间注意力不匹配。

Method: 提出TARA方法，引入令牌掩码避免模块间干扰，并通过训练目标使注意力与概念区域对齐。

Result: 实验表明TARA能高效实现多概念推理，并有效保留各概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA通过避免模块间干扰，显著提升了多概念文本到图像生成的效果。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在空间推理方面表现有限，3DFroMLLM旨在通过生成3D原型来弥补这一不足。

Method: 采用代理式流程（设计师、编码员、视觉检查员）进行迭代优化，无需额外数据或指令。

Result: 生成的渲染图像在图像分类预训练任务中表现优于先前方法15%，并显著提升细粒度视觉语言模型性能（55%准确率提升）。

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM为MLLMs的空间推理和3D生成提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

### [104] [A Parametric Bi-Directional Curvature-Based Framework for Image Artifact Classification and Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08824)
*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向性图像曲率分析的无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）框架，通过定义各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）度量，优化参数后可高效评估图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无参考图像质量评估问题，通过分析图像曲率和纹理特征，提供一种高精度的质量评估方法。

Method: 采用两阶段系统：1）利用两种ATR配置分类主要失真类型（模糊或噪声）；2）通过回归模型将ATR分数映射到质量评分。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，对高斯模糊和白噪声的Spearman相关系数分别达到-0.93和-0.95；分类准确率超过97%，整体系统预测R2为0.892。

Conclusion: 该框架是一种高效的双用途工具，可用于图像失真的分类和量化。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加编码比特率，导致带宽和存储成本上升。

Method: 使用频率注意力特征金字塔预测网络（FFPN）预测最优高频预处理策略，指导后续滤波操作。训练时通过伪标签确定最优策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了框架在视觉质量提升和比特率节省方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在视频编码中实现了比特率与主观质量的最优权衡。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate在场景更新和渲染性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

Motivation: 当前大多数自动化肿瘤分割和报告生成研究集中于术前数据，术后影像分析研究较少。

Method: 使用Attention U-Net进行术前和术后肿瘤分割，DenseNet进行MR序列分类和肿瘤类型识别，并整合到遵循RANO 2.0指南的报告中。

Conclusion: 该管道提升了术后评估和临床决策能力，并集成到开源软件Raidionics中。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在复杂环境条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 新方法通过几何建模更准确地捕捉数据分布和类间依赖关系，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该系统提高了脊柱成像的一致性和可重复性，为手术导航提供了新工具。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Result: 提示聚合显著提升了零样本检测性能，验证了通过高效提示工程利用基础模型多模态知识的有效性。

Conclusion: 无需额外训练，仅通过提示工程即可实现高效的MAD检测，展示了基础模型在生物识别任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Motivation: 传统变化检测方法需要专家知识，且现有CDVQA方法假设训练和测试数据分布相似，而现实中域偏移常见。因此，需要一种能处理域偏移的方法。

Method: 提出TCSSM模型，结合双时相图像和地理灾害相关文本信息，动态预测输入依赖参数，提取跨域不变特征。

Result: 实验表明TCSSM优于现有方法，展示了其优越性能。

Conclusion: TCSSM为CDVQA中的域泛化问题提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

*Zhentao Fan,Zongzuo Wang,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaoCache是一种无需训练、即插即用的缓存策略，通过固定点视角预测噪声输出，特别适用于后期去噪阶段，显著提升视频扩散模型的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的加速方法通常跳过早期或中期去噪步骤，导致结构差异和指令跟随问题，TaoCache旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用固定点视角预测噪声输出，通过校准余弦相似性和范数比来保留高分辨率结构，支持激进跳过。

Result: 在多个数据集上，TaoCache在相同加速条件下，视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）显著优于现有缓存方法。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种高效且兼容性强的加速策略，适用于基于DiT的框架，并能与其他加速方法互补。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在颜色推荐任务中的应用，提出了一种名为ColorGPT的管道，其在颜色建议准确性和多样性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统颜色推荐方法因设计复杂和数据有限而效果不佳，研究旨在验证预训练LLMs是否能成为更优的设计工具。

Method: 开发了ColorGPT管道，通过测试多种颜色表示和提示工程技术，专注于颜色调色板补全和生成。

Result: 实验表明，ColorGPT在颜色建议准确性和调色板多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs在颜色推荐任务中具有潜力，ColorGPT为设计领域提供了新工具。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频令牌并突出关键帧信息的方法，通过动态采样和空间-时间建模，显著提升了视频LLMs的性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs在压缩视频时忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，可能导致遗漏重要信息。

Method: KFFocus采用动态采样策略识别关键帧，并根据上下文相关性分配不同的压缩比率，同时引入空间-时间建模模块。

Result: 在长视频场景的基准测试中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus通过优化视频压缩和建模方法，为视频LLMs提供了更高效和精确的处理能力。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多尺度量化方法（MSQ），用于解决现有运动表示在复杂模式建模和组合灵活性方面的不足，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动表示无法从多尺度捕捉运动，且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了复杂模式建模和多样化生成任务的能力。

Method: 引入MSQ方法，将运动序列压缩为多尺度离散标记，使用不同编码器捕捉空间粒度，并在时间维度插值后量化。基于此建立了生成掩码建模模型。

Result: MSQ方法无需专门设计或重新训练即可无缝组合运动标记，实验表明其在多种基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSQ方法有效解决了运动表示的多尺度捕捉和组合灵活性问题，为运动编辑、控制和生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有大核卷积网络（ConvNets）虽然有效感受野（ERF）大，但参数量和计算成本高，且ERF的渐近高斯分布（AGD）被破坏。

Method: 通过组合小核扩展ERF并保持AGD，设计了Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator和Layer Operator，构建了通用模型UniConvNet。

Result: UniConvNet在ImageNet-1K、COCO2017和ADE20K上表现优异，UniConvNet-T达到84.2%的ImageNet top-1准确率，UniConvNet-XL达到88.4%。

Conclusion: UniConvNet通过组合小核扩展ERF并保持AGD，实现了高效且通用的卷积网络设计，性能优于现有CNN和ViT。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的Inter-correction Retinex模型（IRetinex），用于解决低光图像增强中分解后的残差（ICR）问题，显著提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinex-based方法在低光图像增强中表现出色，但分解后的残差（ICR）被低估，影响了分解精度和最终图像质量。

Method: 提出IRetinex模型，在分解阶段减少光照和反射组件的特征相似性，在增强阶段利用特征相似性检测和减轻ICR的影响。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，通过减少ICR，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ICR的减少显著提升了低光图像增强的效果，IRetinex模型为解决这一问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Motivation: 减少对专家标注的依赖，同时解决现有方法中学生模型依赖和认知偏差的问题。

Method: 提出UC-Seg框架，包含交叉子网一致性保持策略（CCP）和不确定性感知伪标签生成组件（UPG）。

Result: 在多种医学图像模态上表现出优越的分割准确性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: UC-Seg框架有效解决了认知偏差和伪标签生成问题，显著提升了半监督分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，亟需利用大规模未标记数据的方法。

Method: DPGNet包含文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成模块，结合跨域知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个数据集上，DPGNet性能优于现有方法6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet有效利用未标记数据，解决了深度伪造检测中的标注挑战。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺的实际应用中具有显著优势，且性能提升显著。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法在动态环境和领域变化中表现不佳，静态假设的评估指标难以区分正常与异常行为。

Method: 采用主动学习框架，结合人机交互机制，从伪标注结果中识别真实实例，定义自适应阈值。

Result: 在模拟真实场景中，EBI（误差平衡指数）达到68.91，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视频异常检测在动态环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中复杂交通环境下识别未知物体类别的挑战，利用VLMs的世界知识和语义推理能力，避免多阶段误差传播。

Method: 提出VLM-3D框架，结合LoRA高效适应VLMs，并设计联合语义-几何损失（早期使用语义损失，后期引入3D IoU损失）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，感知精度提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失，有效提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来大规模压缩模型的探索以及压缩与智能之间联系的深入研究提供了启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Motivation: 移动设备上部署大型生成AI模型的需求增长，但现有视频VAE的计算瓶颈（如参数过大和内核不匹配）导致内存不足或推理缓慢。

Method: 1. 分析现有VAE架构冗余，引入3D深度可分离卷积减少参数；2. 提出解耦的3D像素洗牌方案优化上采样；3. 开发专为移动设备设计的VAE解码器Turbo-VAED，并通过蒸馏训练快速适配。

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现移动设备上实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于多数视频VAE，成本低至95美元。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏公开的高质量数据集，尤其是全身人体捕捉数据，数字人体表示的重光照和新视角渲染研究进展受限。

Method: 提出HumanOLAT数据集，包含多视角OLAT捕捉的HDR RGB帧，涵盖多种光照条件（白光、环境贴图、颜色渐变和精细OLAT光照）。

Result: 评估现有重光照和新视角合成方法，突显了数据集的实用价值及建模复杂人体外观与光照交互的挑战。

Conclusion: HumanOLAT将推动未来研究，支持严格基准测试和通用及人体特定重光照与渲染技术的进步。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于降噪低剂量儿科X射线，同时保留诊断相关特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，儿科胸部X射线成像对早期诊断至关重要，但低剂量协议引入的噪声会掩盖关键解剖细节。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，平衡噪声抑制与结构细节保留。通过模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声生成训练数据。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，并将肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在资源受限环境下具有显著的诊断价值。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

*Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Kaitong Cai,Zimeng Huang,Xiaofei Sun,Jian Wang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DrDiff是一个新颖的长文本生成框架，通过动态专家调度、分层稀疏注意力和软吸收引导优化三项核心技术，解决了效率与质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长文本生成方法存在效率与质量之间的权衡问题，计算复杂度高且生成速度慢，需要一种能够同时保证生成质量和效率的新方法。

Method: 1. 动态专家调度机制：根据文本复杂度智能分配计算资源；2. 分层稀疏注意力机制：将计算复杂度从O(n²)降低到O(n)；3. 软吸收引导优化策略：结合DPM-solver++减少扩散步骤。

Result: 在各种长文本生成基准测试中，DrDiff表现出优于现有最先进方法的性能，显著提高了生成速度同时保持了模型性能。

Conclusion: DrDiff框架通过三项创新技术成功解决了长文本生成中的效率-质量权衡问题，为高效高质量的长文本生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

### [2] [SSVD: Structured SVD for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Benchmarking under Domain Shift in ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02830)
*Pu Wang,Shinji Watanabe,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次将多种先进的参数高效微调方法（VeRA、DoRA、PiSSA、SVFT）集成到ESPnet中，并针对语音识别任务进行基准测试，同时提出了新的结构化SVD引导微调方法SSVD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的参数高效微调方法主要在语言和视觉任务中发展，在语音领域的验证有限，需要对这些先进方法在语音识别任务中进行系统性评估。

Method: 提出了结构化SVD引导微调（SSVD），选择性地旋转输入相关的右奇异向量，同时固定输出相关向量以保持语义映射；在ESPnet中集成了多种PEFT方法并进行基准测试。

Result: 在领域偏移的语音识别任务（包括儿童语音和方言变体）上进行了评估，模型规模从0.1B到2B，SSVD方法在最小可训练参数下实现了鲁棒的领域适应和提升的效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音领域的参数高效微调提供了全面的基准测试框架，SSVD方法展现出优越性能，所有实现已在ESPnet中开源以支持复现和未来工作。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

### [3] [Clustering Discourses: Racial Biases in Short Stories about Women Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02834)
*Gustavo Bonil,João Gondim,Marina dos Santos,Simone Hashiguti,Helena Maia,Nadia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析LLaMA 3.2-3B模型生成的葡萄牙语短篇小说中关于黑人和白人女性的叙事建构，发现存在社会超越、祖先神话化和主观自我实现三种主要话语表征，揭示了看似中立的文本实际上强化了殖民结构化的女性身体框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查大型语言模型在生成文本时如何构建关于不同种族女性的叙事，特别是揭示看似语法连贯和中立的文本中可能隐含的殖民主义结构和历史不平等问题。

Method: 从2100个生成文本中应用计算方法对语义相似的故事进行分组，然后选择代表性文本进行定性话语分析，结合机器学习技术和人工话语分析的集成方法。

Result: 识别出三种主要话语表征模式：社会超越、祖先神话化和主观自我实现，发现这些看似中立的文本实际上体现了固化的、殖民结构化的女性身体框架，强化了历史不平等。

Conclusion: 研究表明大型语言模型生成的文本并非真正中立，而是复制和强化了现有的社会不平等结构，需要结合计算方法和定性分析来深入理解AI生成内容中的意识形态内涵。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

### [4] [IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02855)
*Hyunji Nam,Lucia Langlois,James Malamut,Mei Tan,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了IDEAlgin评估范式，用于大规模评估LLM在开放式解释性标注任务中的表现，通过"三选一"任务获取专家相似度评分，发现LLM作为评判者比传统向量方法更接近专家判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地应用于开放式解释性标注任务（如主题分析、学生作业反馈），需要一种可扩展的方法来评估LLM生成标注与专家标注的相似性，但目前缺乏有效的评估指标。

Method: 提出IDEAlgin基准测试范式，使用"三选一"三元组判断任务获取专家相似度评分，并比较各种相似性指标（包括基于向量的方法和LLM作为评判者）与人类基准的一致性。

Result: 在两种教育数据集上的实验表明，基于向量的指标无法捕捉专家关注的细微相似性维度，而通过IDEAlgin提示的LLM与专家判断的一致性显著提高（9-30%的提升）。

Conclusion: IDEAlgin为大规模评估LLM在开放式专家标注任务中的表现提供了一个有前景的范式，有助于在教育等领域负责任地部署LLM。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

### [5] [A-SEA3L-QA: A Fully Automated Self-Evolving, Adversarial Workflow for Arabic Long-Context Question-Answer Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02864)
*Kesen Wang,Daulet Toibazar,Pedro J. Moreno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 自我迭代的阿拉伯语长文档QA生成系统，通过多个专门的大视觉语言模型协同工作，实现无人干预的持续学习和性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语长文档QA生成的挑战，提升阿拉伯语大视觉语言模型的长语境理解能力

Method: 使用问题生成器、评估器和答案生成器群的对抗流程，通过闭环迭代精炼性能，支持可控难度级别调整

Result: 经验证在AraLongBench评测集上显著超越静态流水线，大幅提升了阿拉伯语LVLM的长语境理解能力

Conclusion: 该自我迭代对抗流程为阿拉伯语长文档QA生成提供了高效解决方案，同时构建了自动化的文档收集流程

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

### [6] [Advancing Minority Stress Detection with Transformers: Insights from the Social Media Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02908)
*Santosh Chapagain,Cory J Cascalheira,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi,Jillian R. Scheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面评估基于Transformer的架构在检测在线话语中少数群体压力方面的表现，发现整合图结构能持续提升检测性能，图增强的Transformer模型为数字健康干预提供最可靠基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性少数群体因少数群体压力而面临更高的健康问题和精神障碍风险，需要有效的方法来检测在线话语中的少数群体压力

Method: 使用ELECTRA、BERT、RoBERTa、BART等Transformer模型与传统机器学习基线及图增强变体进行对比，评估零样本和少样本学习范式，在两个最大的公开Reddit语料库上进行实验

Result: 整合图结构能持续提升检测性能，监督微调加关系上下文的方法优于零样本和少样本方法，图增强能帮助模型识别身份隐藏、内化污名等关键语言标记

Conclusion: 图增强的Transformer模型为数字健康干预和公共卫生政策提供了最可靠的基础

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

### [7] [English Pronunciation Evaluation without Complex Joint Training: LoRA Fine-tuned Speech Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02915)
*Taekyung Ahn,Hosung Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过LoRA微调多模态大语言模型，可同时完成自动发音评估和错误发音检测诊断，无需复杂结构改动或分离训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要复杂的网络结构改动和分离训练流程来同时处理发音评估和错误检测任务，这个研究旨在通过简化的微调方法实现集成化的发音评估系统

Method: 使用Microsoft Phi-4-multimodal-instruct模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)方法进行微调，仅微调LoRA层而不需全部音频层的完整微调，在Speechocean762数据集上训练

Result: 模型预测的发音评分与人工评分呈现强相关性(PCC > 0.7)，同时获得低词误率(WER) 和音素误率(PER) (均 < 0.15)，仅微调LoRA层即可达到与完全微调相似的性能

Conclusion: LoRA基于方法可以通过简单的训练方法构建集成化发音评估系统，为英语L2学习者提供更可访、集成和有效的计算机辅助发音训练技术

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

### [8] [Decoding the Rule Book: Extracting Hidden Moderation Criteria from Reddit Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02926)
*Youngwoo Kim,Himanshu Beniwal,Steven L. Johnson,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过可解释的词法表格结构从历史审审数据中提取隐式内容审审标准，实现了与神经网络相当的性能同时提供透明的决策见解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社区如subreddits通常擅用多样化的隐式审审标准，而传统内容审审系统需要明确的分类标准

Method: 使用可解释的架构从历史审审数据中识别和提取隐式标准，将审审标准表示为与内容删除相关联的词法表达表格

Result: 提取的词法模式能够有效复现神经网络审审模型的性能，同时揭示了不同社区在表面共享规范下的实际执行差异，发现了社区特定的语言宽容度、主题限制特征以及有害言论分类的深层子类别

Conclusion: 该方法能够系统性地比较不同社区的审审标准，为内容审审系统提供了透明可解释的决策见解，揭示了之前未文档化的审审模式

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏支持装配任务中应用导向系统评估的测试平台，需要促进装配助手的发展。

Method: 采用半自动化的QA标注方法，使用LLM生成候选问题并由人工验证，整合细粒度动作标签来多样化问题类型，并创建指令任务图。

Result: 构建了包含391个QA对的数据集，基准测试表明当前最先进的多模态模型在该任务上仍有很大改进余地。

Conclusion: ProMQA-Assembly数据集可以为程序性活动助手的发展做出贡献，推动装配任务中多模态理解技术的进步。

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理治疗遍及率低，程序性对话语料缺乏，影响了基于大语言模型的心理咨询机器人发展。

Method: 构建包含多个咨询会话的长周期对话语料，结合认知概念图(CCDs)来指导客户模拟，并训练深度咨询模型。

Result: 评估结果显示DiaCBT能够有效提升大语言模型模仿具有CBT专业知识心理学家的能力。

Conclusion: 该数据集为训练更专业的心理咨询对话系统提供了有效支持，有助于扩大心理健康服务的可及性。

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

*Fong-Chun Tsai,Kuan-Tang Huang,Bi-Cheng Yan,Tien-Hong Lo,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过提出新的Balancing Logit Variation (BLV)损失函数，解决自动说话评估模型中的类别不平衡问题，提高少数类的分类准确性和公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动说话评估(ASA)模型常遇到类别不平衡问题，导致对少数类的偏见预测

Method: 提出BLV损失函数，通过干扰模型预测来改善少数类的特征表示，无需修改数据集

Result: 在ICNALE标准数据集上，将BLV损失集成到BERT模型中显著提高了分类准确性和公平性

Conclusion: BLV损失能够有效解决ASA模型中的类别不平衡问题，使自动语音评估更加稳健适合多样化学习者

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

*Chang Su,Dengliang Shi,Siyuan Huang,Jintao Du,Changhua Meng,Yu Cheng,Weiqiang Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出新的训练阶段来增强LLM中[EOS]标记的语义表示能力，通过双向生成重建任务提升文本嵌入质量，在MTEB基准测试中达到新的SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入方法使用[EOS]等特殊标记的嵌入，但这些标记并未经过专门训练来捕获整个上下文的语义，限制了其在检索和重排序任务中的能力

Method: 在对比学习前增加新的训练阶段，采用双向生成重建任务（EBQ2D和EBD2Q），通过交替锚定[EOS]嵌入并重建查询-文档对的两侧来丰富最终标记嵌入的语义

Result: 实验结果表明，额外的训练阶段显著提升了LLM在Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)上的性能，在不同LLM基础模型和规模上都实现了新的最先进结果

Conclusion: 通过专门设计的双向生成重建训练阶段，可以有效增强LLM中[EOS]标记的语义表示能力，从而显著提升文本嵌入质量，为检索和重排序任务提供更好的性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Method: 构建基于结构可学习机制的适配器微调方法，通过可微分门函数和结构稀疏控制变量，自动优化适配器插入点、激活路径和模块组合，在训练过程中按需构建任务特定的高效子结构。

Result: 在多个多任务自然语言理解任务上，该方法超过主流的参数高效微调技术，在准确率、压缩率以及对噪声和干扰的稳健性方面实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态结构优化机制，有效提升了大语言模型在多任务微调中的参数利用率、表征能力和稳健性，为参数高效调整提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业情感分析是自然语言处理的重要应用领域，传统RNN存在梯度消失问题，需要改进模型来提高情感分析的准确性和实用性。

Method: 使用长短期记忆网络(LSTM)作为改进的RNN模型，采用产品评论数据集，70%数据用于训练，30%用于测试，并与传统RNN模型进行对比。

Result: 提出的改进RNN模型达到了91.33%的准确率，性能优于传统RNN模型。

Conclusion: LSTM模型能有效解决梯度消失问题，在商业情感分析中表现优异，可帮助企业根据客户反馈评估营销策略。

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

Motivation: 语言特征如复杂性或情感性具有自然的连续语义结构，虽然LLM是测量标量结构的有吸引力工具，但其对数值输出的特殊处理需要系统评估最佳应用方法

Method: 使用政治科学文献中的多个数据集，评估四种方法：未加权直接点评分、成对比较聚合、token概率加权点评分和微调

Result: 直接提示LLM生成点评分会产生不连续分布；成对比较能改善测量质量；token概率加权点评分效果更好；微调小模型仅需1000个训练对就能匹配或超越提示LLM的性能

Conclusion: 为应用研究人员提供了实用建议：推荐使用token概率加权方法，小模型微调是经济有效的替代方案

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

TL;DR: 通过知识编辑注入指纹保护LLM知识产权，提出FSFT方法减少细调过程中的指纹退化，性能提升10%，但仍面临特征相似性带来的识别困难


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的指令循环注入指纹方法存在性能下降、计算资源消耗大、模型修改后持续性差等问题，需要更轻量的知识产权保护方案

Method: 首次将知识编辑应用于指纹注入，使用类似乱码文本的指纹防止被覆盖，并提出Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT)方法来约束指纹子空间的更新，减少大规模细调时的退化

Result: FSFT方法在最坏情况下也能超过普通细调方法10%的性能，但发现注入指纹的模型因特征高度相似而无法区分指纹和相似文本

Conclusion: 知识编辑是一种轻量且有效的LLM指纹注入方法，FSFT能显著减少细调过程中的指纹退化，但仍需要更加健壮和细粒度的指纹注入技术来应对特征相似性带来的挑战

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

Conclusion: 该研究为罗曼语语言提供了重要的评测资源，显示了当前机器翻译技术在少数语言方面的不足，尤其是在向少数语言翻译方面。

Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for
machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six
varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five
regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our
reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++
benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An
automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何直接微调预训练大语言模型（LLMs）来处理流程数据，而不需要将事件日志转换为自然语言。通过参数高效微调技术，在预测性流程监控任务中实现了更好的性能和更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流程挖掘领域中的LLM应用主要集中在提示工程或将事件日志转换为叙事格式数据。研究者发现LLMs在生成token序列方面的优势与流程挖掘的目标相似，因此想尝试直接适配预训练LLMs来处理流程数据。

Method: 采用参数高效微调技术，减少计算开销。实验设计重点关注预测性流程监控（PPM），考虑单任务和多任务预测。对比当前最优的递归神经网络（RNN）方案和最新的叙事格式解决方案。

Result: 微调后的LLM模型在预测性能上澄现出超越当前最优RNN方案和叙事格式解决方案的潜力，特别是在多任务设置中。同时，这些模型还展现出更快的收敛速度和更少的超参数优化需求。

Conclusion: 直接微调预训练LLMs来处理流程数据是一种有效的方法，能够避免将数据转换为自然语言的需求。通过参数高效微调技术，可以在保持计算效率的同时实现更好的预测性能，为流程挖掘领域提供了一种有前景的新方法。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估主要关注全球或英语中心主题，忽视了低资源语言和文化特定内容。自动翻译的多语言基准存在错误和文化语境失真问题，需要专门针对低资源语言的文化适配评估。

Method: 创建SinhalaMMLU数据集，包含7000多个选择题，覆盖中学到大学教育水平，基于斯里兰卡国家课程，涵盖6个领域30个科目，包含通用学术知识和文化根基知识。

Result: 评估26个LLM显示：Claude 3.5 sonnet准确率67%，GPT-4o准确率62%，整体模型性能有限。模型在人文学科等文化丰富领域表现尤其不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在低资源语言和文化特定语境下的适应仍有很大改进空间，需要更多针对特定文化和语言背景的评估基准来推动模型的文化适配能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

Motivation: LLM多智能体系统虽然性能优越但脆弱性高，现有推理LLM在故障归因任务上准确率低于10%，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出AgenTracer框架：1) 通过反事实重放和编程故障注入标注失败轨迹，创建TracerTraj数据集；2) 使用多粒度强化学习训练轻量级AgenTracer-8B模型进行故障诊断。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，AgenTracer-8B比Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet等大型专有LLM性能提升高达18.18%，并为MetaGPT和MaAS等现有多智能体系统带来4.8-14.2%的性能提升。

Conclusion: AgenTracer为LLM智能体系统故障归因设立了新标准，能够提供可操作的反馈，使智能体AI具备自我纠正和进化的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

Motivation: 语言模型在现实应用中需要世界知识，但模型如何将数据转化为知识表示的过程尚不清晰，需要工具来研究这些内部过程以开发更一致、稳健和完整的知识表示。

Method: 提出LMEnt套件：1）基于维基百科的完全实体标注的知识丰富预训练语料库；2）比先前方法提升80.4%的基于实体的检索方法；3）12个预训练模型和4000个中间检查点。

Result: LMEnt提供了分析实体提及与下游性能联系的受控环境，研究发现事实频率是关键因素但不能完全解释学习趋势。

Conclusion: LMEnt支持语言模型知识表示、可塑性、编辑、归因和学习动态的研究，相关资源已发布供研究使用。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，面临的任务越来越复杂多样，可靠评估变得困难。LLM作为评估者的范式虽可扩展，但在复杂任务中的可靠性尚未充分研究，特别是涉及多维度评分标准、非结构化参考答案和细微评判标准的情况。

Method: 构建ComplexEval挑战基准，系统性地暴露和量化辅助信息诱导偏见。研究了6种先前未探索的偏见，涵盖12个基础场景和3个高级场景。

Conclusion: 深入分析为提高评估信号的准确性和可验证性提供了关键见解，为开发更通用和鲁棒的评估模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

Motivation: 沙特手语(SSL)作为沙特阿拉伯84,000余人的主要沟通方式，但现有技术主要集中在非阿拉伯手语，缺乏专门的阿拉伯手语资源。阿拉伯语言的复杂性和现有数据集主要关注单词而非连续语句，导致了这一空白。

Method: 研究人员创建了第一个连续沙特手语数据集KAU-CSSL，重点关注完整句子。提出了一种基于Transformer的模型，利用预训练的ResNet-18进行空间特征提取，并使用双向LSTM的Transformer编码器来处理时序依赖关系。

Result: 模型在依赖签名者模式下达到了99.02%的高准确率，在独立签名者模式下也获得77.71%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项研究为沙特手语社区提供了重要的资源，不仅有助于改善沟通工具，还对手语识别领域做出了重要贡献，为阿拉伯手语的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

Abstract: As AI technology advances, research in playing text-based games with agents
has becomeprogressively popular. In this paper, a novel approach to agent

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究多模态大语言模型在视频中的像素级视觉基准能力，特别是识别物体运动模式的能力，并提出了一个专门测试运动理解能力的基准MoCentric-Bench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在视频任务中展现了良好的表现，但对于像素级视觉基准能力的研究较少，特别是能否利用运动信息进行物体分割。现有基准存在缺陷，单帧图像就能满足大部分运动指代表达式的需求，无法真正测试模型的时间推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Conclusion: 主动特征采集方法有潜力提升主动脉瓣狭窄诊断效率，使超声心动图评估更加高效、可扩展和个性化

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Motivation: 解决医学影像中模型在真实世界分布偏移下泛化能力不足的问题，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中的域泛化挑战。

Method: 结合视觉变换器和基于临床病变本体的符号推理，通过结构化规则特征和视网膜血管分割，采用置信度加权集成策略融合深度视觉表示，并通过最小化域嵌入的KL散度来实现单域和多域泛化。

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅是增强可解释性，更是有效的正则化器。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet是一种基于U-Net的太阳细丝分割架构，通过引入可学习的边缘图来增强自注意力机制，显著提高了细丝边界和分支的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在H-alpha观测中难以捕捉太阳细丝的精细结构（特别是分支），主要原因是长程依赖建模能力和空间细节捕捉能力有限。

Method: 在U-Net骨干网络上引入直接从输入图像衍生的可学习边缘图，通过边缘信息线性变换注意力键值矩阵，指导瓶颈层的自注意力机制更好地捕捉细丝边界。

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上，EdgeAttNet超越了U-Net和其他基于U-Net的transformer基线，实现了更高的分割精度和显著更好的细丝分支识别，同时推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过将结构先验显式整合到注意力计算中，EdgeAttNet在减少可训练参数的同时增强了空间敏感性和分割精度，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

*Xianbao Hou,Yonghao He,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Hu Su,Wei Sui,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA是一个无需训练的双智能体系统，通过文本智能体和图像智能体的协作，有效提升实例分割数据集的多样性和质量，在LVIS 1.0验证集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高、类别不平衡的问题，同时弥补现有方法中大型语言模型与扩散模型协作不足以及训练数据信息利用不充分的问题。

Method: 提出双智能体系统：1) 文本智能体(T-Agent)通过Prompt Rethink机制迭代优化提示词，促进LLM与扩散模型的深度协作；2) 图像智能体(I-Agent)基于训练图像生成新实例来丰富数据分布。两个智能体都是独立自动化的流程。

Result: 在LVIS 1.0验证集上，相比基线方法提升了+4.0 box AP和+3.3 mask AP，相比领先模型DiverGen提升了+0.3 box AP和+0.1 mask AP，在常见类别上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过创新的双智能体架构和Prompt Rethink机制，有效解决了实例分割数据增强中的关键挑战，为高质量数据集构建提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

Motivation: 传统的基于原型的方法通常为支持图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，当支持图像和查询图像存在显著差异时会影响匹配效果

Method: 提出SPENet网络，包含：1）多级原型生成模块（MPG），同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型；2）查询引导局部原型增强模块（QLPE），利用查询图像指导自适应细化支持原型

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的大量实验表明，SPENet优于现有的最先进方法，取得了优越的性能

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型生成和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化问题，提升了分割性能

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

Method: 提出SOPSeg框架，包含区域自适应放大策略保护细粒度细节，定制解码器集成边缘预测和渐进细化，以及针对遥感应用中广泛采用的定向边界框的新提示机制。

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)存在错误地将文本输入视为图像内容的倾向，通过识别特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)来检测视觉缺失，并提出方法来修正输出错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉和文本输入时，经常错误地将文本中缺乏视觉证据的概念误认为是图像内容，导致错误响应。

Method: 识别特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)，开发检测模块来分类输入token是否具有视觉基础，并通过重新解释问题提示或替换检测到的缺失token来优化输出。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效缓解了模型错误假设文本输入视觉存在的倾向，并在各种LVLMs中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 通过识别和利用VA神经元的激活模式，可以系统性地检测视觉缺失并改进LVLMs的输出准确性，提高模型对视觉-文本输入的联合理解能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Method: 采用双分支跨模态特征提取管道，提出域内语义对齐和域间语义对抗学习策略：对齐相同语义的视觉和文本特征，同时惩罚前景和背景特征之间的相似性

Result: 在两个整体ReID基准和两个遮挡ReID基准上的综合实验证明了方法的有效性和通用性，结果达到或超越了当前最先进方法

Conclusion: 背景语义在行人重识别中具有重要价值，联合建模前景和背景信息的双分支框架能有效提升模型性能，特别是在处理复杂遮挡场景时

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: MedLiteNet为皮肤癌计算机辅助诊断提供了一种高效准确的轻量级分割解决方案，特别适合医学小样本数据集的应用场景。

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

Conclusion: 动态条件方法显著提升了模型在多份任务不良问题中的表现，解决了传统激洞模型的限制。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to

cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIM-Net是一个时间序列变化检测网络，通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，确保变化区域和变化时刻结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，因此需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: CAIM-Net包含三个关键步骤：差异提取与增强、粗粒度变化时刻提取、细粒度变化时刻提取与变化区域推断。使用轻量级编码器提取差异特征，通过边界增强卷积放大特征，进行时空相关性分析，最后利用多尺度时间CAM模块推断变化区域。

Result: 该方法能够同时指示变化发生的位置和时间，确保变化区域和变化时刻检测结果的一致性。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过从变化时刻推断变化区域的方法，有效解决了时间序列变化检测中变化区域和变化时刻结果不一致的问题，为生态系统动态监测提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

TL;DR: 通过梯度基础自我反思方法估计不同到征的影响力，并在影响感知对比解码框架中利用这些信息来同时减少多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏见和共现偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型存在幻觉问题，主要由文本-视觉偏见和共现偏见导致。现有方法没有考虑不同实例中偏见水平的波动，需要一种无需额外资源的有效减少幻觉的方法

Method: 首先使用梯度基础的自我反思方法估计不同到征类型（视觉、提示和之前输出）的影响力，然后在影响感知对比解码框架中利用这些信息来检测物体相关的视觉到征并减少偏见

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能够有效减少幻觉，在LLaVA-QA90数据集上达到了最92%的准确率提升

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种无需额外资源的方法，通过梯度基础自我反思和影响感知对比解码，能够同时减少多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏见和共现偏见，有效提升模型的准确性

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法存在穿透、接触区域间隙问题，且难以捕捉手部在交互过程中的真实变形，需要更精确的交互建模方法。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，使用基于引力场的扩散桥模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互，并引入文本语义信息指导引力场构建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效消除穿透、确保稳定抓握、捕捉真实手部变形，生成物理合理的交互效果。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法通过引力场扩散桥成功解决了手-物体交互中的关键挑战，为精确的交互建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

TL;DR: 提出了TADM-3D模型，一种3D时间感知扩散模型，用于准确预测MRI脑部结构随时间的变化，通过脑龄估计器和双向时间正则化来改善时间关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要局限：无法明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系、仅依赖扫描插值缺乏临床实用性、大多基于2D架构忽略3D解剖上下文。需要开发能够准确预测脑部病理进展的3D模型。

Method: 使用预训练的脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成反映预期年龄差异的MRI；提出反向时间正则化(BITR)，通过双向训练（从基线到随访和从随访到基线）提高时间准确性。

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC数据集的外部测试集上验证了泛化性能。

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够准确预测脑部MRI的进展，通过脑龄估计和双向正则化有效解决了时间关系建模问题，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的损失函数（负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失），用于3D生物医学分割任务，重点保持细长结构的连续性和长度，在轴突起始段分割中显著减少了不连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级精度更重要，特别是对于信号丢失导致的间断问题。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络结合两种新损失函数：负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失，并采用下采样和间距校正等实验设计策略。

Result: 相比标准CNN和现有拓扑感知损失，新方法显著减少了每个实例的分割不连续性，特别是在输入信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 在损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用中分割的可靠性。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

Conclusion: Count2Density能够从计数级标注中有效提取空间信息，每个组件都有效提升了模型性能，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Conclusion: 军事领域需要大型代表性数据集来进一步评估投毒攻击风险和补丁检测机会；AutoDetect方法为投毒检测提供了简单、快速、轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Conclusion: 该方法为低剂量CT成像提供了更安全、更准确的解决方案，在图像质量和临床应用方面都显示出显著优势

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过统一文本生成和多模态特征融合，有效解决了fMRI诊断中的关键挑战，为脑疾病诊断提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass
Fusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI

*Qihang Zhou,Shibo He,Jiangtao Yan,Wenchao Meng,Jiming Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于CLIP的2D异常检测能力，PointAD+通过显式和隐式3D表征结合，实现了对未见对象的空间异常和渲染异常的全面检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP在2D领域的健壮异常检测能力转移到3D领域，以识别具有高度多样化类语义的未见对象的3D异常

Method: 设计PointAD+框架：1)隐式3D表征（PointAD）通过点-像素对应表示渲染异常；2)显式3D表征通过G-aggregation涉及几何信息识别空间异常；3)层次表征学习结合两种表征；4)跨层次对比对齐促进层间交互

Result: 大量实验证明PointAD+在未见对象的零样本3D异常检测中体现优势，能够完整理解异常语义

Conclusion: PointAD+通过统一框架综合渲染和空间异常信息，成功将CLIP的2D异常检测能力扩展到3D领域，实现了对多样化类别对象的全面异常检测

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 长思维链数据对轻量级多模态语言模型推理能力提升至关重要，先进行监督微调再结合强化学习可显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索验证奖励强化学习在参数少于70亿的轻量级多模态语言模型中的有效性，以及长思维链数据对提升此类模型推理能力的作用

Method: 使用长思维链数据进行监督微调(SFT)，随后进行强化学习(RL)阶段

Result: 长思维链数据的SFT显著提升MLLM推理能力，后续RL阶段可带来额外性能增益

Conclusion: 使用长思维链数据的SFT阶段是开发轻量级MLLM推理能力的关键前提条件

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星形胶质细胞是重要的胶质细胞，其形态和密度变化是许多神经系统疾病的标志。但由于其复杂的分支结构和染色依赖性变异，自动检测极具挑战性。

Method: 采用混合CNN-Transformer检测器，结合局部特征提取和全局上下文推理。使用热图引导的查询机制生成空间锚点，轻量级Transformer模块改善密集簇中的区分能力。

Result: 在ALDH1L1和GFAP染色星形胶质细胞数据集上，模型持续优于Faster R-CNN、YOLOv11和DETR，通过FROC分析确认具有更高的灵敏度和更少的假阳性。

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer架构在稳健的星形胶质细胞检测方面具有潜力，为先进的计算病理学工具提供了基础。

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云转换为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，无需特定任务训练即可显著改善砖级分割效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境下获取高分辨率RGB图像不切实际，而点云虽然对暗光环境鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且有噪声的，限制了细粒度分割能力

Method: 将砖石点云通过虚拟相机投影为深度图，采用去噪扩散零空间模型(DDNM)进行恢复，无需特定任务训练，最终使用Segment Anything Model(SAM)进行砖级分割

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验显示，该方法在砖级分割方面有显著改进

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion展示了在砖石资产自动化检测方面的潜力，特别是在低光照环境下替代RGB图像的可行性

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时捕捉全局依赖关系和保持局部一致性，导致长程交互和边界细节难以兼顾

Method: 使用Transformer捕获全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播阶数动态学习图结构，采用图残差机制保持全局信息

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架有效解决了高光谱解混中全局与局部特征的平衡问题，具有鲁棒性和训练稳定性

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

Motivation: Vision Transformers在图像分类中性能强大但计算成本高，需要在不牺牲精度的情况下降低大型ViT模型的推理成本

Method: 使用轻量级视觉模型在推理时估计token重要性，选择性丢弃低重要性token，无需修改架构且兼容多种ViT模型

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，FLOPs减少高达80%，精度退化极小

Conclusion: 该框架具有良好的泛化能力和实际应用价值，可用于高效的ViT分类

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标对概念定制任务的评估要么过于狭隘要么过于泛化，与人类偏好存在偏差，特别是在多概念评估中难以准确评估概念间的交互关系

Method: 提出分解式GPT评分(D-GPTScore)，将评估标准分解为更细粒度的方面，并使用多模态大语言模型(MLLM)进行方面级别的评估；同时发布了包含单概念和多概念任务的人类偏好对齐概念定制基准(CC-AlignBench)

Result: 该方法在基准测试中显著优于现有方法，与人类偏好的相关性更高

Conclusion: 这项工作为概念定制评估建立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在乳腺癌分型上表现优异，而且具有良好的扩展性，可以轻松适配其他癌症类型和额外模态，无需重新训练现有模态。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于状态空间模型(SSMs)的在线密集视频字幕生成方法，通过转移状态机制解决长序列处理问题，实现7倍计算量减少和实时处理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集视频字幕方法在处理长视频时面临计算复杂度和内存限制，且需要完整视频输入，无法进行在线处理

Method: 使用时标缩放的状态空间模型(SSMs)结合转移状态机制，扩展SSMs在时间维度上的处理能力，保持长序列和循环特性

Result: 方法在密集视频字幕任务中表现良好，能够很好地适应不同视频长度，计算量减少7倍

Conclusion: 所提出的模型特别适合在线或流式处理，无需等待完整视频处理，具有更好的实用性

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Motivation: 解码低信噪比EEG信号中的视觉神经表征面临挑战，需要提升语义对应性和模态数据的有效整合。

Method: 使用文本模态提供显式语义标签，在共享多模态空间中对齐图像和EEG特征，采用适配器模块、模态一致性动态平衡策略和随机扰动正则化来优化模型。

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上，方法在Top-1和Top-5准确率指标上分别提升2.0%和4.7%，超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过多模态整合和创新的模型优化策略，该框架能够有效地从低信噪比EEG信号中解码视觉神经表征，为神经工程领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Conclusion: JTGD通过联合训练策略有效提升了道路缺陷检测的性能和效率，为边缘设备部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models

model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Motivation: 当前缺乏专门研究遗传对手写影响的数据库，需要建立一个综合性数据库来回答如下问题：手写是否存在遗传因素？手写是否可以遗传？家庭关系是否影响手写？

Method: 采集了210个家庭（包括祖父母、父母、叔伯、姑姘、兄弟姑妹、堂兄弟姑妹、姑侄等）的手写样本，包括数字、字母、形状和自由段落。使用特殊设计的表格收集并记录所有写作者的家庭关系。

Result: 通过对家庭成员手写特征的比较和研究，发现了他们手写特征和写作风格之间的相似性。建立了一个免费向模式识别社区开放的数据库。

Conclusion: 该数据库是目前为止唯一的这类数据集，希望能为研究遗传和家庭关系对手写的影响开启新的研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench是一个全面的文本到图像生成基准测试，评估模型的组合和推理能力，包含1080个复杂提示和13500个检查问题，发现现有模型在复杂场景中的组合能力有限，推理能力更是瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成基准测试在评估组合和推理能力方面存在局限，无法全面评估模型能力，且当前基准测试的场景密度低、推理简单，无法满足复杂真实场景的需求。

Method: 构建包含12维评估分类法的基准测试，围绕场景图元素（实例、属性、关系）构建组合能力评估，围绕哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳、溯因）构建推理能力评估，每个提示具有高组合密度和多步推理。

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验显示，在复杂高密度场景中，模型的组合能力仍然有限，而推理能力更是严重滞后，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素。

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的评估基准，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力上的局限性，特别是推理能力是关键的瓶颈，需要进一步研究和改进。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.
